To people complaining about the script not being accurate, hit the back button a bit and you'll see written next to it 'DRAFT' in big letters. This means that this isn't the script you see on screen. You get a TRANSCRIPT, which is a copy of what happens on screen, and you get a SCRIPT, which is either a draft, and how it relates to the movie depends on how early in production it was-which is why we're given DATES.
I fell in love with the movie the first time I saw it, and it still gives me the giggles. I still laugh when they first meet Patrick, I still 'aaw' at the prom and I still mutter heinous things about Patrick being an idiot at the end.</p><hr><p><b>XxRacixX</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>OMG such a kool film i love it !! i think heath ledger is sooooo fit in it and i think it is really sweet at the end when he gets the guitar for kat!! it is sooooo kool! i love the school counsellor lady she is so funny as well!</p><hr><p><b>gellicat</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I don't know why you're all having a go at Sam Shepherd he is totally right. He never said the film wasnt good just that the script here was wrong, which it definitely is.</p><hr><p><b>Jesse</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>Ok, I'm so sick of films like this and scripts with this crappy romance and stuff. 2 out of ten because the chick in it wasn't totally ugly.</p><hr><p><b>chelsea</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie, Heath Ledger is so good!</p><hr><p><b>Suzannah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie so much! I've seen it so many times that I could almost re-write the script word for word. Heath Ledger is so hot in this movie also but ever since he has cut his hair really short it looks really stupid, and almost ugly.</p><hr><p><b>crystall.c</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This movie is so great, I've watched it millions of times and I never get tired of it at all.</p><hr><p><b>Hilary</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of the best movies I've seen. As a matter of fact it's my favorite! I like the different personalities and all the romance.</p><hr><p><b>nitsad1981</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie, Heath was awesome! There are a lot of movies with schools and proms but this one was the best of them all. I never get tired of watching it on and on.</p><hr><p><b>Barbie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie even though we were made to study it in class for our film study I still love it to bits. It's just the best movie ever! Although the whole paintball thing is a bit corny, jeez shooting each other and then turning around to kiss. I mean how ironic is that.</p><hr><p><b>LOVE YOU</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is great, it's the best movie I have ever seen.</p><hr><p><b>natalie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie I've seen it say ten thousand times it's so good some of my friends haven't seen it yet but I've told them they must because it's so good. We watched it for our year 9 english it's a ramake of Shakespeare's play Taming of the Shrew.</p><hr><p><b>stella</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Heath Ledger is hot.</p><hr><p><b>sexc haly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Heath is hot, he's so adorable.</p><hr><p><b>Krystala</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I thought this film was great, I also don't know why everyone's making a big deal about what Sam Shepherd said, he's right the script did suck.</p><hr><p><b>Anne</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really love this movie. It's a movie that you can watch so many times and you won't get bored.</p><hr><p><b>chicky poo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really love this movie. Tthe only reason I didn't give it a ten was because... well I'll think of one. Ahh what the heck 10! And I reckon all you idiots who reckon it was crap, you should have been the ones with the dicks on your faces.</p><hr><p><b>piscesmarche</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I fell in love with this movie. It's so romantic.</p><hr><p><b>Donnate</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is great and I can watch it millions of times.</p><hr><p><b>Musica101</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>*scroll to top* - and that just goes to shows Liam hasn't read Sam's post properly! An easy script, an easy film to watch. No difficult concepts! Based on the Taming of the Shrew by Shakespeare - interesting to connect the characters in the film with the characters in the play. The script is not *wrong* - it is just an early draft without the directors alterations and actors improvisations. The director of the film will cut out scenes and change dialogue to suit their means, actors will improvise on camera (around their lines). So the script is not going to be EXACTLY the same.</p><hr><p><b>monti</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is one of my all time favs! I love it so much. And I agree with stella and sexc haly, Heath is so gorgeous!</p><hr><p><b>Kayla_CuteFace</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is my sister and I's favorite movie ever, it's amazing. I watch it all the time and I never get sick of it. It's a comedy, a romance. It's something for everyone. I can say almost every line is amazing.</p><hr><p><b>Nomiree</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely love this movie, and when I found out we were studying it for english, I was thrilled .

However, that script is COMPLETELY untrue to the movie- is that the original? Did they change it significantly from that? 

I gave the movie a 10 rating, but I wouldn't give the scripting a 1.</p><hr><p><b>Amoretto</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I don't know why you like this movie and I don't try to know. But I love it too. This movie is so cute and reveals the depth of peoples minds.</p><hr><p><b>AJ</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I don't give a damn what the other people said because anyone who gave it ANYTHING less than a 7 is a stupid idiot and shouldn't be able to watch another movie in their life! I loved this film. It comes second to Happy Gilmore! It's got a great plot and has great actors including Heath Ledger and Julia Styles.</p><hr><p><b>jess</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I LOVED this movie. I found the sense of humour rare; it was smart stupid.</p><hr><p><b>Christina</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think this movie was so easy to relate too, I loved it. Perfect.</p><hr><p><b>elisabeth</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>When cameron and micheal are throwing the paper down the stair way, what song is playing?</p><hr><p><b>Emma</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Man I love this movie (even if I've only seen half of it) And the script here is the original one, not the one used in the movie. But still amazing.</p><hr><p><b>Kate</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. It's very entertaining and you really can't stop once you start to watch it. Heath Ledger is good in it; and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is very sweet. Bianca is annoying, but Katarina is a fascinating character.</p><hr><p><b>OK</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I prefer some of the dialogue in this script to that of the film. It's somehow more enjoyable. I was surprised to read the change in Ms. Perky's line! In a good way. She was probably my favourite character in the movie. 10 Things was just a typical movie. Typical, typical, typical. Some things were different to usual teen romance movies, but not much. Too predictable and safe. I found it rather boring and wasn't swayed as I should have been in the film. For instance, in the end scene with the poem I burst out laughing because it just wasn't believable. Lame movie, but not the worst.</p><hr><p><b>Jacobb</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'm a big fan of this movie. I've seen it over a thousand times and I don't remember seeing a lot of these scenes in the movie. The ending in the movie was when the guy bought Kat a guitar and they kissed. A band was playing on the roof of the school. They must have deleted some of the scenes in the screenplay and added some, but I'm not too sure. The movie is great, I love the drama and romance. I write screenplays similarto this, but I'm inspired by George Lucas and John Hughes. This is a great screenplay, I'm looking forward to reading more of the writer(s) work and hopefully my writing can compare to it. I'm a beginner at writing screenplays, and this screenplay made me want to keep on writing. It's great! Keep up the work! Is there a way that I can submit my screenplays on this website?</p><hr><p><b>Ryno</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>Reading the script, I couldn't believe that the actors read it and thought that this is a great script (I know that this is only a draft script).  My opinion is that the actors actually made the movie.  The actors in the movie was much cooler than the characters portrayed in the script.

The script was a bit boring.  I read better scripts.  Movie itself was not bad.</p><hr><p><b>Mike</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>For people that say the script is wrong, are you retarded. This is not the shooting script but one of the original scripts for the movie. Yeah it is not word for word what you see in the movie since things changed from this script to what is actually in the movie.</p><hr><p><b>Kait</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. It is really interesting to see how they transformed the original script into the script used for the movie. I miss Heath Ledger.</p><hr><p><b>Joy</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>As someone who was an extra in this flick (I went to the school they used for Padua) I thought reading one of the earlier spec scripts was interesting. I think that the finalized translation to screen was much better and being an aspiring screenwriter it gives me hope that if something as average/simple as this can be made into a big budget film then maybe my stuff can too. My rating is for the script here, not the movie.</p><hr><p><b>Emma</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie so much I have watched so many times at school and home. I know the whole movie like the back of my hand.</p><hr></td>
