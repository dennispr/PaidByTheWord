WIDE ON a plume of black smoke rising high into the air.
CLOSER ON a 1965 Ford Galaxy engulfed in flames.

DOROTHEA (55, short grey hair, Amelia Earhart androgyny) and JAMIE
(15, New-Wave/Punk) jog their shopping cart toward the commotion,
stunned to find their car in flames. Dorothea looks at the car and
then at her son Jamie, concerned. People run for help. Sirens in
the background.

<b>                    DOROTHEA (V.O.)
</b>
          That was my husband's Ford Galaxy. We
          drove Jamie home from the hospital in
          that car.

<b>INT. DOROTHEA'S LIVING ROOM
</b>
Dorothea and Jamie slouch on couch, with "JEEVES" the cat,
watching her favorite film CASABLANCA.

<b>                    DOROTHEA (V.O.)
</b>
          Since then it's just been us.

Track in on television playing the famous end of the film.

<b>                    RICK / BOGART
</b>
          You're getting on that plane.

<b>                    ILSA / BERGMAN
</b>
          I don't understand what about you?

<b>                    RICK / BOGART
</b>
          I'm staying here with him till the
          plane get's safely away.

<b>                    ILSA / BERGMAN
</b>
          No Richard, what has happened to
          you, last night....

<b>BACK TO VONS PARKING LOT: THE HULK OF THE CAR SITS IN A FOAMY
</b><b>WHIPPED CREAM PUDDLE. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CLEANS UP. POLICE ARE
</b><b>THERE. DOROTHEA IS GREGARIOUS WITH THE FIREMEN WHO WORK AROUND HER.
</b><b>JAMIE WATCHES, STILL STUNNED, LIFE'S SURPRISES.
</b>
<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>
          Listen, Captain. I am having a
          party tonight, it's my birthday
          actually, and I would like you to
          drop by so I can feed you
<b>                                                           3.
</b>
<b>                    FIRE CHIEF
</b>
          It's not necessary Mrs. Fields.

<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>
          It's Dorothea - no, I insist,
          please? That way I can thank you.

She hands her address to them.

<b>EXT. PARKING LOT - SIDE OF FIRE TRUCK - DAY
</b>
Jamie and Dorothea sit on a side bumper of a fire truck,
movement around them. They look small, sit close, groceries
at their feet.

Dorothea watches Jamie. The fire scared her. She looks
vulnerable.

<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>
          That was a beautiful car.

<b>                    JAMIE
</b>
          Mom, it smelled like gas and
          overheated all the time, and it was
          just old...

Dorothea's surprised, she didn't know they felt so
differently about the car.

<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>
          (What?) Well it wasn't always old.

Dorothea goes to touch his hair. He bends away from her hand.
Jamie turns to his mom, trying to explain the contemporary
world to her.

<b>                    JAMIE
</b>
          You know, when the firemen come,
          people don't usually invite them
          over for dinner.

Camera tracks away, revealing them like refugees in the
parking lot.

<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>
          Yeah? Why not?

<b>MAIN TITLE ON BLACK: 20TH CENTURY WOMEN
</b><b>                                                          4.
</b>
<b>INT. MARY'S THERAPY PLACE - DAY
</b>
Camera pans across teen therapy girl (IMPROVISE THERAPY
TALK), sees a circle of 6 other teen girls having therapy,
lands on JULIE (17, Something subversive below her good
looks) similarly bored. The therapist MARY, (40's academic)
listens. Julie stares at Mary, criticality brewing inside of
her.

<b>EXT. OUTSIDE MARY'S OFFICE
</b>
Julie lights up a cigarette, her real self, gets on her bike.

<b>EXT. MONTECITO STREETS - DAY
</b>
Julie smokes and rides her bike, her real self more on view.

<b>INT. OBGYN OFFICE
</b>
ABBIE (28, Sophisticated NYC art-punk type) stands in gown in
OBGYN office, looking confused, vulnerable, but armed with a
late 70's clunky Nikon camera. She studies her doctor putting
a swab into a tube, writing her name; she takes a photograph.

Turns and takes a photo of the room, her doctor is used to
this.

She watches an assistant come in and take the swab (and her
future fate) in its plastic container away - go down the
hall, and disappear around a corner.

<b>INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY
</b>
The technician carries the little swab down the hall, in a
clear plastic bag.

<b>INT. DOROTHEA'S SIDE DOOR
</b>
Abbie walks in, looking lost, puts her bag down in the
kitchen.

<b>INT. ABBIE'S ROOM
</b>
Now in her room, Talking Heads playing loudly, her pain peaks
and she begins to dance alone.

<b>EXT. DOROTHEA'S HOUSE
</b>
Julie rides her bike past a line of old VWs and an old 30's
Chevy.

<b>INT. DOROTHEA'S HOUSE
</b>
Julie enters the house, walks towards WILLIAM (Mid 40's post
hippie type).
<b>                                                            5.
</b>
William takes on a major job on his own (tearing down ceiling
in entry way). Reveal that this is a big house, needing
repair under serious renovations.

<b>                     WILLIAM
</b>
          Oh, hey, sorry.    Jamie's not here
          right now.

Julie walks past this. Follows the sound of music upstairs.

<b>INT. HALLWAY/ABBIE'S ROOM
</b>
Julie can see Abbie dancing through a partially opened door,
Abbie captivates her, she walks towards the room, Abbie sees
her, snaps out of her dancing, turns off the record.

Julie enters, Abbie's still troubled by her OBGYN visit,
Julie can't really take her eyes off Abbie.

<b>                     ABBIE
</b>
          They're not home.

Abbie takes her picture.

<b>                     JULIE
</b>
          Don't.

That doesn't stop Abbie. Not mean, just stubborn.

<b>                     ABBIE
</b>
          I'm taking pictures of everything
          that happens to me in a day.

<b>                     JULIE
</b>
          I don't like having my picture
          taken. I didn't happen to you.

She takes another.

<b>INT. DOROTHEA'S KITCHEN AREA
</b>
Dorothea and Jamie make their way to the kitchen with all the
groceries.

<b>                     DOROTHEA
</b>
          Hello.
<b>                                                             6.
</b><b>                       WILLIAM
</b>          Hey.
William enters and helps them, Julie and Abbie enter a beat
later.
<b>                       DOROTHEA
</b>          Hi.
She hands William a bag of groceries.
<b>                       DOROTHEA
</b>          You aren't going to believe what
          happened.
<b>                       JAMIE
</b>          Our car burst into flames in the
          parking lot.
<b>                       JULIE
</b>          Seriously?
<b>                       WILLIAM
</b>          You OK?
<b>                       ABBIE
</b>          How did it happen?
<b>                       DOROTHEA
</b>          I don't know, they said probably
          just something electrical. We
          walked out and it was just sitting
          there, on fire.
Life's surprises.
<b>                       WILLIAM
</b>          Oh man, I'm sorry.


Everyone's perplexed.


William helps unload groceries. Julie and Jamie IMPROV in
background.
<b>                                                          7.
</b><b>DOROTHEA PULLS ABBIE ASIDE, LOOKS AT HER, ABBIE DOESN'T WANT
</b><b>TO SHARE.
</b><b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>          So, what happened?
<b>                    ABBIE
</b>          They never tell you anything, I
          won't know for like a week.
Dorothea gives her an encouraging look.
<b>                    ABBIE (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm gonna be late on rent.
<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>          That's okay, Don't worry about
          that.
<b>                    ABBIE
</b>          Thanks.
Abbie looks at Dorothea with love and admiration.
<b>INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>Jamie lies flat on his bed. Julie's next to him, processing,
earnestly worried for him.
<b>                    JULIE
</b>          What if you had been in the car?
He shrugs, gestures with his hand. She lays beside him on her
side. She traces a finger across his hair, his forehead,
nose, chest, their hands touch.
<b>                    JAMIE
</b>          I wouldn't be here. You would've
          missed me?
<b>                    JULIE
</b>          (Yeah) Don't joke.
She traces a finger across his hair, his forehead, nose,
chest, their hands touch. He puts his hand on her bare knee,
starts to slide up her leg. She easily pulls his hand off.
<b>                                                             8.
</b><b>                    JULIE (CONT'D)
</b>          It was so much easier before you
          got all horny.
He's tried this before, but he is really just her friend.
He leans away from her.
<b>                    JAMIE (CONT'D)
</b>          It's not like you, don't -
<b>                    JULIE
</b>          Do it?
She likes that she does it. He smiles, used to her love of
being provocative. Then serious.
<b>                    JULIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Friends can't have sex and still be
          friends.
She snuggles him again innocently, pressing her face into his
arm.
<b>                    JULIE (CONT'D)
</b>          I like us like we are - OK?
<b>                    JAMIE
</b><b>          OK?

The nurses and doctor scramble around him, doing vitals,
asking questions.
<b>                       DOCTOR
</b>          What's your name?
Confused, but present.
<b>                       JAMIE
</b>          Jamie... Jamie Fields.
Dorothea looks on relieved but destroyed by this.
<b>FAST MOTION ENDS.
</b><b>INT. JAMIE'S HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT
</b>Jamie's asleep in hospital bed, Dorothea sits next to him
worried, touching his hair. She gets up.

waiting in the hallway. This means a lot to Dorothea, she
sit's next to them.

</b><b>INT. STAIRS - DAY

eying him. Her worry and fear rising, until she says...

</b>          Why did you do something so -
          stupid (dangerous).
<b>                      JAMIE
</b>          I don't know mom, everyone was
          doing it.
Escalating fear and anger with each line.
<b>                      DOROTHEA
</b>          So you just went along with it?
<b>                      JAMIE
</b>          It looked like fun.
<b>                      DOROTHEA
</b>          That's just dumb. Why would you do
          something so stupid? Just following
          along? You know you almost died,
          right?
He gets very defensive, feels attacked.
<b>                      JAMIE
</b>          You don't need to worry about me.
She doesn't buy it.
<b>                      DOROTHEA
</b>          Why don't you think?
He turns away from her.

He walks off to his room. She follows.

</b>She storms into his room, when she enters he heads to the
other side. Dorothea's quite angry now.

He confronts her like he never has before.
<b>                    JAMIE
</b>          I'm not the one who doesn't talk.
Dorothea's surprised.
<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>          What? Come on, you scared the hell
          out of me. Why did you hurt
          yourself like that?
<b>                    JAMIE

(Some specificity) Why don't you go on dates?

He storms off, she's struck, she sits alone, she cries.
<b>INT. DOROTHEA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>Dorothea, still struggling, enters the living room, a movie plays
blankly on the TV, she's surprised to find Jamie asleep on the
couch.
She sits and looks at him, something she doesn't get to do in peace
anymore - thinking as she looks at him.

clad happy beachgoers. Dorothea looks at the girls, nervous.
She starts walking.

</b>
           I think history's been tough on men, they
           can't be what they were, and they cant

Julie and Abbie look to each other and Dorothea. What's she
asking?

<b>                     DOROTHEA (CONT'D)
</b>
           He needs help figuring out how to

<b>                    JULIE

Very vulnerable for Dorothea, like a failure.

<b>I/E. MONTECITO STREETS - DOROTHEA'S CAR - DAY
</b>From inside Dorothea's car we watch Jamie skateboarding down a
steep street. Dorothea loves this, we see her smile at his taking
flight.
MOMENTS LATER: The car is parked at the bottom of the hill. She's
just delivered the news. Jamie's angry, mortified, confused. She's
more vulnerable and scared than she knows.

He gets out of the car, slams the door, but doesn't know exactly where
to go. She's heartbroken but sticking with her plan.

He skates off - his face filled with anger.
She's not used to him being this mad at her. She watches him get
further and further away.
<b>EXT. SKATE DITCH OR SKATE RAMP - DAY
</b>Jamie skates with other kids. 7-10 kids hang out, some skating,
some watching, smoking, talking.
Jamie's still angry. He overhears some older, tougher looking punk
kids talking about going to a punk show in LA.
Jamie approaches them, they look at him.

excitedly about their adventure. Jamie mostly watches, but he loves
this adventure.

</b>A seedy section of Sunset, Jamie finishes a call and hangs up a
payphone.

</b>Dorothea, Abbie, and William are eating. Jamie's conspicuously
absent, a place set for him. William returns to the table from the
phone.
<b>                    WILLIAM
</b>          That was Jamie. He's in LA, him and some

<b>INT. DOROTHEA'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Hard cut to Dorothea working on the house late at night. William
sees Dorothea down the hall, working away, hard on herself. She
looks up and sees him. Why is it easy for her to be vulnerable with
William?

<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>
          Maybe I did do the wrong thing?

</b>
          Well there's an energy crisis, that must
          be playing into it.

He just looks at her sincerely, why joke?

He doesn't react. She leaves the room, seemingly fine.

dark.



<b>INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Julie sneaks into his window. The way she does it tells us
she's done it a lot.

She whispers for him but he's not there. Has this ever
happened? She sits on his bed, lonely.

William's still recovering from Dorothea's rejection. Abbie pops
in, filled with energy.

          Maybe just shoot all my stuff,
          everything I own, or everything
          that's important to me. A portrait

Longer eye contact than usual.

He touches her hair. She closes her eyes, melts more than she
thought she would, just to be wanted is nice. She never tells
people about her cancer.

She can't believe he still wants to fool around. Everyone
else treats her like a leper. Takes her a beat to assess
what she feels capable of.

He kisses her. She smells his hair.

him again.

</b>          Of all the misconceptions about

          they're falling in love, but
          they're not actually falling in

What can Dorothea say? Abbie can see this is true.

</b>          I guess so. You'll get through
          this. You will get through it.
          You will do it. This is the really
          hard part. And then what happens

with Abbie. It's a lot to take in.
AFTER A BEAT OF THAT - Dorothea comes to the door. She
pauses, processing all that she just heard from Abbie.
Dorothea enters the room.

He does in slow motion, softly. She liked that. She leaves.

He picks up a magazine and does his best imitation of an
adult who belongs there, but he's really just a nervous 15
year old punk kid pretending to read TIME.

A VERY PREGNANT TEENAGE GIRL enters, the weight of the world
on her face. Jamie can't stop looking at her.

<b>INT. PHARMACY - DAY
</b>Jamie searches through the shelves in the women's section. He
finds what he's looking for: an early E.P.T. pregnancy test.
At the counter, the PHARMACIST looks at it, perplexed. It's
new to him. He figures out what it is. The pharmacist,
appalled, BUT lets him buy it.
<b>EXT. ROAD - DAY CONTINUOUS
</b>Jamie skateboards down a long Montecito street.
<b>INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>Jamie and Julie sit in her bedroom. She unpacks the E.P.T
kit. A lot of glass, hard angles, and mirrors, it looks very
space-age. She's never seen anything like it before, glances
at the instructions.
<b>                      JULIE
</b>          Fuck, what is that?
<b>                      JAMIE
</b>          It's a pregnancy test.
LATER: The door to Julie's attached bathroom is closed. She's
in the bathroom, not happy about peeing in a cup. Jamie sits
on the bedroom floor. Quiet, then the sound of pee in a cup.
They speak through the door.
<b>                      JAMIE
</b>          The doctor said, Abbie won't be
          able to have kids.
Look of confusion and heaviness on Julie. She opens the door,
tube filled with urine in her hand.
<b>                      JULIE
</b>          Why'd she take you?


Julie's jealous.

</b>          Now what?
<b>                       JAMIE
</b>          Um, shake for 10 seconds.
She shakes the vial. Counts to ten, very nervous. He inspects
it, reads the next part of the instructions.
<b>                       JAMIE
</b>          Leave undisturbed for 2 hours.
She's shocked.
<b>                       JULIE
</b>          Two hours?
<b>                       JAMIE
</b>          Yeah, that's what it says. If it
          appears then you're positive, if no
          ring appears then the test is
          negative.

<b>EXT. JULIE'S SAN YSIDRO CREEK, UNDER BRIDGE - DAY
</b>Jamie and Julie stand in front of a long circular tunnel and
smoke. Jamie holds the cigarette wrong, inhales wrong. He
inhales, coughs. Looks at the cigarette.
<b>                       JULIE
</b>          That's not how guys smoke. Don't

She imitates a real guy smoking.

</b>          Like this. Hold it like this.
He echoes her smoking moves. Still off.

</b>            Guys don't look like they're
            thinking about what they look like.
JULIE IMPROVS acting like a man: holding a cigarette,
posture, walking. Jamie follows, mostly thinking this is just
a laugh.
<b>                       JULIE
</b>            See?
He continues imitating her, but then he coughs. He throws his
cigarette away, grossed out. She teases him playfully.

</b>Julie and Jamie sit and talk.   She smokes.
<b>                       JULIE
</b>            It's just my opinion, I think being
            strong is the most important
            quality, it's not being vulnerable,
            not being sensitive, it's not even
            about being happy, it's about
            strength and your durability
            against the other emotions.

Julie's not easy to intimidate. She stares Dorothea down.
<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>          I've had new guys.

A reflective beat, they say goodbye and Julie gets out of the
car.
Dorothea drives off, more unnerved than she expected.
<b>INT. DOROTHEA'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>Dorothea re-enters. Jamie's finishing the stocks - surprising
Dorothea a little.
<b>                      JAMIE

He's been lying to her, so why would she tell him the truth?

That means a lot to her. She's processing their life together a
bit. William's watching them.
<b>                      DOROTHEA
</b>          IBM's down again huh?
Jamie leaves. Dorothea watches him go down the hall. She lights up.
Observes William.

</b>          I guess I wouldn't know would I?
Abbie enters, awkwardly avoiding William, he's not used to being
treated that way. Dorothea clocks all of this, amused, bit of a
trouble maker.
<b>                       DOROTHEA
</b>          Let's go out tonight? I'd like to see
          this modern world.
On Abbie's surprise.
<b>                       WILLIAM
</b>          Can I come?
<b>INT. BAUDELAIRES - NIGHT
</b>Abbie leads Dorothea and William into the grungy, graffiti-lined
club filled with Santa Barbara's punks. A local post-punk band
blares from the stage.
Dorothea would never appear intimidated, but this is a strange and
loud new world for her. William too.
Dorothea and William get a drink at the bar.
<b>                       DOROTHEA
</b>          I don't know if I'm going to find an
          appropriate man here.
<b>                       WILLIAM
</b>          You might.
He's looking right at her. He touches her hand on the bar, she
looks at his hand like it's a foreign object.
<b>                       DOROTHEA
</b>          Hello -
He leans in and gently kisses her on the lips, hoping she will get
him out of the traps he's made. She seems completely unstirred.
<b>                       DOROTHEA
</b>          What was that? What does that mean?
<b>                       WILLIAM

</b>          It's nothing serious.
<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>          Then why do it?


She turns away from him coldly, but we see the kiss affected her.
A band begins to play, a distorted WALL OF SOUND. Kids head toward
the stage, some begin to dance. Dorothea walks through the crowd,
curious about this world. Dorothea makes her way to the front, into
the sea of noise and strobe light. William watches, impressed by
Dorothea's willingness.

CLOSE ON Dorothea, strobe lit, her expressions searching for
hope and meaning in this music, as her face goes ON...OFF...
ON...OFF the music cross fades to score.

She points him to Abbie, begins to head out, turns back and looks
at the 79 punks and the band in the distance.

</b>Dorothea enters, lost in her thoughts, walks through the rooms.
Jamie's half asleep, watching TV in the living room, half
waiting up for her, a role reversal.

loves.

past Julian, "Hey, what happened?" She's running down the
street.
It takes a block for William to catch up to her, he has to
pull her to a stop. He has something to tell her.
<b>                      ABBIE (V.O.)

in a chair across from him, sneaking peeks at him.
There is something calming about it, and his strange little

up. The sound wakes him up, she mimes `keep going, I'm fine,
I'm just gonna smoke while I meditate.'

regret. She touches him sweetly, somehow older than she was an hour
ago, more alive to how complicated it all is.
She punches him in slow motion.

          What about the other one? The art fag
          one?

CUT TO: William and Dorothea listening to TALKING HEADS "THE BIG
COUNTRY." The music is odd, but spacious.

William does a more fluid, semi-hippie dance. Dorothea does an
imitation of him, half mocking him. He smiles.

</b>
          I guess we're more art fag types.

Jamie, Abbie and the others make their way down the beach, lit only
by Abbie's flashes. They're drinking, rowdy. Trish has her arm around
Jamie.

          show a man that I find him attractive. If
          I do so, he may react as if I had

stops, long pause.

really helping, she's excited by what's been happening.

Dorothea sounds more angry.

Abbie tries to reach out, only making things worse.

She feels horrible, and surprised, reeling.
Jamie's silent.
<b>                     JULIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Let's get out of here, like you
          said, let's go up the coast. Just
          the two of us.
Off Jamie, looking like he's going to shut her down.
<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>Dorothea finds the note Jamie left.
<b>                     JAMIE (V.O.)
</b>          Mom. Julie and I took the car.
          We're taking a trip up the coast.
          Just to get away. You don't need
          to worry about us.
<b>I/E. 101 FREEWAY - DAY - MONTAGE
</b>Dorothea's VW bug makes its way up the 101.
Classic California coast. Half painted over "ART FAG" still
visible on the side of the car. Inside the car, Julie smokes
and drives, punk cassette on the radio.
Jamie stares out the window, his arm around the back of her
neck. They look like a couple in love.
<b>EXT. RUGGED COASTLINE
</b>Julie and Jamie explore the rugged rocks along ocean.
They sit on some rocks, the rough ocean down below.
<b>EXT. BAUDELAIRES CLUB - NIGHT
</b>Weeknight at the club, only the usual denizens are dancing.
After a beat we reveal Dorothea entering the punk club alone.
She's not really looking for jamie, she's looking for his
world.

<b>EXT. S.L.O. LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
Jamie and Julie eye a skeezy middle aged man on his way in.
<b>                                                         88.

The man takes the money, walks in.
<b>                    JULIE
</b>          Strawberry, or anything berry.
<b>I/E. S.B. STREETS - 39 FORD - NIGHT
</b>Dorothea smokes and drives - dealing with her frustration.
Then cops lights behind her.
CUT TO: Cop asking her questions.
<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>          What's the matter?
<b>                    COP

</b>          Yes. I need to see your license.
Dorothea's anti-authority thing kicks in.

</b>          Well what if I don't have my
          license?

          It's a little forward.
She looks at him mischievously.
<b>                                                        89.
</b><b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>Julie smokes in bed and undresses. Jamie comes in and sits
on the bed. Something's brewing in Julie. Jamie's looking
confused, out of body himself.
<b>                     JAMIE
</b>          I love you.
He tries to be sweet and caress her, she pulls away.
<b>                        JAMIE
</b>          What's wrong?

</b>          But that's like, your version of

</b>Jamie rises, hurt and angry, gets dressed.
<b>                    JULIE
</b>          Jamie?
He doesn't talk. He leaves in a rush.
<b>EXT. SAN LUIS OBISPO HOTEL
</b>Jamie exits the room, and takes off.
<b>EXT. SAN LUIS OBISPO - NIGHT
</b>Jamie hurriedly walks the streets of this sleepy town alone.
<b>INT. S.B. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
</b>Dorothea waits on a bench, after being processed. Long shot down
the hall, Abbie walks up to her and sits by her. Dorothea, hair a
mess and kind of sweaty looks at her confused, down the hall she
can see William waiting patiently, not wanting to add to her pain.
<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>          These people have no sense of
          humor.
<b>                    ABBIE
</b>          Let's get out of here.
Abbie neatens Dorothea's hair, tidies her up a little bit, takes
her arm and they walk out past the male cops, who don't get out of
the way, Abbie has to shoulder butt one as they pass, holding their
dignity together.
<b>INT. ABBIE'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>Abbie drives her home. She's exhausted, doesn't want any pity or
judgement.
<b>INT. DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>Abbie helps Dorothea into bed, gets her a glass of water.
<b>                    ABBIE
</b>          Having a kid seems like the hardest
          thing.
<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>          How much you love the kid is the

</b>Abbie feels the loss of what she can't have.
<b>EXT. SLO AGRARIAN FIELD - DAWN
</b>Jamie, strung out and tired is walking down a dirt road next to an
agrarian field. As he walks, a group of 30 or so Latino migrant
workers cross the road and the frame. They're heading to work, some
are as young as Jamie it seems, he stops as they all cross him,
none of them look at him. Two different worlds.
<b>INT. DOROTHEA'S KITCHEN - MORNING
</b>Dorothea enters, finds Abbie and William at the table. She looks at
them, not sure, mixed feelings, anger and vulnerability.
<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>          Julie called, they're in San Luis
          Obispo, but she can't find him.
She looks at them, more open and real.
<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>          Will you guys please come with me?
          Up there?


<b>I/E. 101 FREEWAY - 1939 FORD - MORNING
</b>William drives Dorothea and Abbie up the 101 freeway.
<b>EXT. CENTRAL COAST - SAME LOCATIONS AS THE BUG
</b>Beautiful landscape, the Ford makes its way up the coast.
<b>EXT. HOTEL ROOM PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>The Ford pulls up, Julie's waiting, smoking. Dorothea comes to her
concerned. Julie's totally torn up, she looks like she knows she
fucked up.
<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>          Where is he?
Julie points to the edge of the hotel, down by the oak tree.
To Julie's surprise, Dorothea touches her sweetly.
<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>          Thanks for calling me.
<b>                                                         92.
</b><b>EXT. DRY CREEK BED - DAY
</b>Dorothea finds Jamie, alone, angry, at first not wanting to talk to
her. They've both been up most the night, they both look rough. He
walks away, she follows.
<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>          Julie's a really complicated woman. I'm
          impressed in a way, but that's a lot to
          take on.
He keeps walking, heads into the connecting vineyard. She calls after
him, he doesn't look back, she follows. Catches up with him.
<b>                    JAMIE
</b>          Aren't you going to get Julie? To
          come talk with me?

</b>          What?
<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>          I thought they'd help.
That stops him, changes him.
<b>                    JAMIE
</b>          It just seemed like you couldn't
          deal with me anymore.
<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>          Look. I wanted. I. I don't want
          you to end up in the same place as
          me.
<b>                    JAMIE
</b>          What does that mean?
<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>          Well, I wanted you to be happier. I
          just didn't think I could do it by
          myself.

</b>          Okay..I thought we were fine
          though, just me and you.
<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>          Yeah?
<b>                    JAMIE
</b>          Yeah.
<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>Dorothea, Abbie, Julie, Jamie and William sitting in the room
eating take out dinner. JUMPS CUTS; Dorothea finds an oldies
station, 30's-40's music plays.
Dorothea teaches Jamie to dance, Abbie joins in, then Julie
and William, they all find a partner.
A small moment of grace between these 5 people.
<b>EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>Abbie, Julie and William are loaded up in Dorothea's car, waving,
heading off. IMPROV GOODBYES.
Dorothea and Jamie are alone now, they have to face each other.

She's not really comfortable with that.

</b>          Really?
<b>                    JAMIE

Dorothea can't relate, but wants to relate.
<b>                                                         94.

</b>Jamie and Dorothea have a picnic.

</b>          Were you and dad ever in love?
<b>                    DOROTHEA
</b>          At first. Or maybe I was just supposed to
          be in love. Or scared that I'd never be
          in love. So I picked the best solution I
          had at the time.
<b>INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - DAY
</b>JUMP CUTS: Dorothea washes Jamie's hair / rubs in the dye / waits
with the little plastic baggy over his head / washes it out / dries
his hair. She feels deep bittersweet heartbreak, loves him so much,
understands him so little.
<b>                    JAMIE
</b>          Are you lonely?
<b>                    DOROTHEA

          something might happen between us, OK?
<b>                    JAMIE
</b>          What about having that in the real world?
<b>                    DOROTHEA

</b>          I thought that was just the beginning of
          a new relationship with her, where she'd
