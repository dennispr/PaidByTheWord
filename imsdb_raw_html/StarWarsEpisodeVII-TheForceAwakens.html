</b>
         The long-haired, bearded GRINDELWALD sits motionless,
         magically fixed to a chair. The air shimmers, charged with
         spells.

         ABERNATHY peers in at GRINDELWALD from the corridor.

         A baby Chupacabra -- part lizard, part homunculus, a blood-
         sucking creature of the Americas -- is chained to
         GRINDELWALD'S chair.


<b>3        INT. MACUSA, CORRIDOR BETWEEN CELLS - SHORTLY AFTER  (NIGHT) 3
</b>
         PRESIDENT SERAPHINA PICQUERY and RUDOLPH SPIELMAN walk at
         pace toward an ominous-looking door past endless pairs of
         guards.

<b>                                 SPIELMAN

                       I expect.

<b>                                 PICQUERY
</b>                       We'd be more than happy to keep him
                       here in custody.

<b>                                 SPIELMAN
</b>                       Six months are enough. It's time
                       for him to answer for his crimes in
                       Europe.

         As they reach the door, ABERNATHY turns and acknowledges
         them.

<b>                                  ABERNATHY
</b>                       President Picquery, Mr. Spielman,

                       to travel.

         SPIELMAN and PICQUERY peer into the cell at GRINDELWALD.

</b>                       It was necessary. He's extremely
                       powerful. We've had to change his
                       guard three times -- he's very...
                       persuasive. So we removed his

</b>
         Cells resembling cages rise in tiers.

         Prisoners chant and bang against the bars as the bound
         GRINDELWALD is transported upstairs, suspended magically in
         midair.

</b>
         A hearse-like black carriage, drawn by eight THESTRALS,
         waits.

         AURORS 1 & 2 climb into the driver's seat, the rest force
         GRINDELWALD inside.

                       hidden away.

         He hands over a black rectangular box.

<b>                                     PICQUERY

</b>                       And we found this.

         He holds a vial of some glowing gold substance in the palm of
         his hand.


<b>                                                                              (CONTINUED)

</b>         SPIELMAN reaches for the vial, which hangs on a chain, and
         after a moment of hesitation, ABERNATHY releases it.

         Inside the carriage, GRINDELWALD raises his eyes to the roof
         as the vial is passed to SPIELMAN.

         SPIELMAN climbs into the carriage. AUROR 1 driving, AUROR 2
         beside him. The door closes.

         A series of padlocks emerges from the carriage doors. An
         ominous drumroll of clicks as padlocks fasten themselves in
         place.

<b>                                     AUROR 1
</b>                       Yah!

         The Thestrals take off.

         The carriage plummets, then soars away through torrential
         rain. More AURORS follow on broomsticks.

         A beat.

         ABERNATHY steps forward, holding the Elder Wand. He looks up
         at the carriage, growing ever smaller. He Disapparates.

<b>                                                                  CUT TO:

</b>
         The underside of the carriage.

         ABERNATHY Apparates, clinging to the wheel shaft.


<b>7        INT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE  (NIGHT)                                               7
</b>
         SPIELMAN and GRINDELWALD sit, eyes locked, flanked by AURORS,
         all pointing their wands at GRINDELWALD.

         GRINDELWALD'S wand box lies on SPIELMAN'S lap.

         SPIELMAN holds up the vial, dangling from its chain.

<b>                                 SPIELMAN
</b>                       No more silver tongue, eh?

         But GRINDELWALD is transforming...
<b>     4.

<b>8         EXT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE  (NIGHT)                                               8
</b>
          ABERNATHY adjusts his grip underneath the carriage.

          His face too is changing. His hair is turning blond and
          lengthening... he is GRINDELWALD.

          He raises the Elder Wand.


<b>9         INT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE  (NIGHT)                                               9
</b>
          GRINDELWALD'S rapid transformation into a tongueless
          ABERNATHY is almost complete.

<b>                                    SPIELMAN
</b>                               (shocked)
                        Oh!


<b>10        EXT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE  (NIGHT)                                          10
</b>
          Now fully transformed, GRINDELWALD Disapparates from the
          underside of the carriage...

          ...and Apparates next to the driver's seat, where he is
          spotted by AURORS 1 & 2. GRINDELWALD points his wand at the
          carriage reins, turning the black ropes into living snakes
          that ensnare AUROR 1 so he falls from the carriage, back
          through the night sky, past the broomstick riders.

          GRINDELWALD casts another spell so the black ropes of the
          reins bind AUROR 2 like a chrysalis, launching him forward in
          the air, then slingshotting him back to knock AURORS 3 & 4
          from the rear of the Thestral-drawn carriage. They fall away
          into darkness.


<b>11        INT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE  (NIGHT)                                          11
</b>
          All wands reverse their direction to jab dangerously at the
          necks of SPIELMAN and the two remaining AURORS.

          SPIELMAN watches as his wand melts into dust.

          The carriage rocks dangerously, both doors open. As
          GRINDELWALD'S head appears at the window, the panicking
          SPIELMAN opens the wand box on his lap.

          The Chupacabra leaps out and sinks its fangs deep into
          SPIELMAN'S neck. He wrestles it.

          The vial falls to the floor.
<b>     5.

<b>12        EXT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE  (NIGHT)                                          12
</b>
          GRINDELWALD drives the carriage down onto the Hudson River,
          chased by the AURORS on broomsticks.

          The carriage wheels graze the surface of the water. The
          broomstick riders are catching up.

          GRINDELWALD touches the Elder Wand to the river and at once
          the inside of the carriage begins to fill with water.

          He lifts the carriage back up into the air.


<b>13        INT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE  (NIGHT)                                          13
</b>
          Submerged in the water, the two AURORS, SPIELMAN, and
          ABERNATHY hold their breath.

          SPIELMAN attempts to grab the vial, which is floating loose
          in the water, but the Chupacabra blocks his path.

          ABERNATHY, with hands still bound, manages to capture the
          vial in his mouth.


<b>14        EXT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE  (NIGHT)                                          14
</b>
          Still driving the carriage, GRINDELWALD swirls his wand in
          the air toward the surrounding storm clouds.

          One by one, forks of lightning strike the broomstick riders,
          knocking each in turn from the sky.

</b>

                         love as a dark twin, an only
                         friend. If Credence has a real
                         brother or sister out there who can
                         take its place, he might yet be
                         saved.

                         either in danger or a danger to
                         others. We may not know who he is
                         yet, but he needs to be found. And
                         I rather hoped you might be the one
                         to find him.

                    has been horrendously abused: Scars across its face, it is

                    And the Obscurus dives, pelting the Shield Charm like a
                    million bullets, rising and re-forming and diving again, but
                    though the magical barrier trembles, it is not broken.

                    attic, the Obscurus slams inward and CREDENCE re-forms.

                    on the tap. Suddenly           his face twitches. He raises his
                    bandaged hand to his           eye and rubs it, shaking his head. He
                    removes his hand and           stares at his reflection.

                    WE CLOSE IN: A tiny tentacle is visible at the corner of his
                    eye. He whimpers in distress and gropes in his suit pocket
                    for a small bottle of bright green liquid, which he drops
                    into his eye with a dropper.

                    Another whimper of pain as the tentacle withdraws. He looks
                    at his reflection. It seems normal. He puts his hat back on
                    and leaves.

                    He holds out his hand and she lets him pull her up.

                    He leads her past a few trees until they reach the one where
                    Bowtruckles are climbing and fighting and playing. They
                    freeze at the humans' approach but relax when they recognize
                    NEWT. He holds out a finger. One of them jumps on.

                    She is watching him, not the Bowtruckles. NEWT reaches across
                    to her, the Bowtruckle standing on his wrist. His hand grazes
                    hers.

                    From their bloody palms rise two glowing drops of blood,
                    which mingle and merge to create one. A metal shape begins to

                    The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus slips out of his pocket onto
                    the floor. TINA picks it up and opens it to the prediction
                    KAMA has underlined.

                    NEWT'S case is open on a table. The Zouwu roars from inside.
                    TINA turns to look at it, listening.

                                         I've seen one of these before. It
                                         was at the fair. There was this
                                         dame there, and she had a veil. I
                                         gave her a nickel and she told me
                                         about my future.
                                              (beat)
                                         She missed out on quite a bit,
                                         actually.

                    WE CLOSE IN ON: the orb, into dark billowing smoke and

                    he is gone, FLAMEL turns anxiously back to the orb. Black
                    flames are swirling around it.

                    FLAMEL shuffles back into his studio and opens a cupboard. We
                    glimpse glass vials, tubes, and the glowing Philosopher's
                    Stone. He heaves from a shelf a padlocked book embossed with
                    a phoenix. He touches the padlock and it springs open.

                    CLOSE ON THE BOOK: as he flicks through it.

                    Each page holds a photograph captioned with a name. FLAMEL

                    JACOB steps out of the narrow staircase into an underground
                    amphitheater and is confronted by a terrifying sight.

                    Thousands of witches and wizards mill around, some already
                    seated on stone benches. The atmosphere is edgy. Some are

                    ROSIER appears onstage. Bowing, she presents the skull-hookah
                    to GRINDELWALD.

                    Total silence falls in the auditorium. GRINDELWALD is
                    illuminated by the skull's golden light. He inhales deeply
                    through the tube. His eyes roll up into his head. He
                    exhales...

                    ... and it is extraordinary. A gigantic Technicolor cloak
                    seems to unfurl from his lips across the high stone ceiling,
                    bearing moving images--the crowd gasps --

                    The vision of a nuclear blast rocks the amphitheater. It is
                    horrifying. The crowd feels it, is terrified. Screams, until
                    the vision subsides, leaving murmurs of panic...

                    CREDENCE is staring out at the sky, scared of what he has
                    done but awed by the magnificent vista.

                    WE PAN OUT TO SEE: Nurmengard, high on its mountain.

                    GRINDELWALD and QUEENIE are watching CREDENCE through the
                    half-open door into a grand drawing room.

                    She smiles as he bows her out through a separate door.

                    Once he is sure she has gone, he walks into the drawing room
                    to join CREDENCE.

                    From behind his back he takes a handsome wand.

                    We see that DUMBLEDORE is hollow-eyed. His usual calm has
