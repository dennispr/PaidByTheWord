    Somewhere, more like NOWHERE...

    But let's be honest, we all know where. As darkness lifts...
    The iconic notes from "ONLY YOU" by The Platters are all
    around us as images slowly come into view...

    Grey clouds fill the sky. Lazy snowflakes flutter down onto a
    light dusting of fresh snow covering the landscape.

    We track low. Following familiar (but different) black and
    red boots as they crush earth below. The hilt of familiar
    (but different) swords glint in the winter light. This lone
    red-suited figure is on a mission. The montage of tight
    vignettes continue as a familiar voice welcomes us:

<b>                        DEADPOOL (V.O.)
</b>              You, know for a long time I wasn't
              sure I'd ever be back. Disney
              bought Fox. There was a whole
              boring rights issue, blahbity-
              blahbity-blah. But then it turned
              out they wanted me. The one guy who
              shouldn't even have his own movie,
              much less a franchise. Marvel's so
              stupid. Look, we all saw the
              trailer. We know the title of this
              thing, so I know what you're
              wondering. How are we going to do
              this without dishonoring Logan's
              memory? And I'll tell you how...
<b>2                                                                    2
</b><b>    EXT. NORTH DAKOTA - GRAVESITE - DAY

    CLOSE ON: A familiar makeshift wooden CRUCIFIX, turned forty-
    five degrees to form an `X.'

<b>                        DEADPOOL (V.O.)
</b>              ...We're not.

    The camera slowly drifts back from the iconic `X', widening
    to reveal an "I LIKE ME" MUG perched atop a rock.

    Wider still now, we see chunks of dirt being flung up and out
    of a hole in the ground, never seeing the source of the
    earthen projectiles, just the metronomic sound of spade
    impaling earth.

<b>                         DEADPOOL (V.O.)
</b>               I'm going to let you in on a little
               secret. Wolverine is not dead.
               Sure, it made for a perfect ending
               to a very sad story. But that's not
               how regenerative healing factors
               work. You think I want to be out
               here in Butt-Fuck North Dakota
               digging up the one and only
               Wolverine? No thank you. But the
               fate of my entire world is at
               stake. He may not be living his
               best life, but he sure as hell
               ain't dead.

<b>    SHUNK.
</b>
    The sound STOPS as contact is made. Contact with...something.

<b>                         DEADPOOL (O.C.)
</b>               Well, there you are. Yes, yes, yes,
               yes.

    The grave-robber stands upright for the first time,
    revealing:

<b>    DEADPOOL
</b>
    Standing waist deep in a hole of his making. His suit is new.
    Bespoke. He pokes around with the tip of his beat-up old
    shovel, confirming something is under there. He vanishes down
    into the hole again, furiously clearing the last layer of
    earth. Fistfuls of dirt and roots go flying.

    Below the frame, the sound of Deadpool's digging stops as we
    sense he's found what he came looking for and it's...
    disappointing.

<b>                         DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
</b>               Come on. Son of a bitch. AGHH
<b>               MOTHER-FUCKER-- MY WORLD IS FUCKED.
</b>
    Deadpool throws a mini-tantrum, punching the air, knocking
    over the pile of dirt. Smashing the `X' with a home-run swing
    of his shovel. Breaking the shovel across his thigh and
    tossing the parts into the hole, only to have the metallic
    shovel-tip come bouncing right up and out back at him.
    Finally exhausted, Deadpool stands upright, spins, and falls
    backwards right into the hole and out of sight.
<b>                        2ND BLUE REV. (04/17/24)                3.

</b><b>    EXT. NORTH DAKOTA - LOG NEAR GRAVESITE - DAY

    We see Deadpool sitting. Talking. As we continue to drift
    slowly past, we reveal Logan sitting beside him. They are
    sitting against the very same tree where Logan died in LOGAN.
<b>                                                                    *

</b>              That was weird. I'm much calmer
<b>                                                                    *
</b>              now. Look, I'm not a man of
              science, but you seem incredibly
              passed away.
                  (sighs)
              But it's good to see ya.

    The adamantium skeleton is seated in a casual pose. Legs
    folded elegantly like Cary Grant at a dinner party. If Logan
    wasn't completely decayed and held together by A FEW rotting
    tendons, it would look like two dudes hanging out in the
    woods.

<b>                        DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
</b>              I've gotta be honest. I've always
              wanted to ride with you, Log'. You
              and me, getting into it. Deadpool
              and Wolverine just fucking shit up.
              Can you imagine the fun? The chaos?
              The residuals?
                  (in Australian accent)
              G'day mate. There's nothing that'll
              bring me back to life faster than a
              big bag of Marvel cash.
                  (without accent)
              Me too, Hugh. But no. No, no, no.
              You had to get all noble and die
              for real. Goddamnit, I could really
              use your help right now--

    The words are no sooner out of Deadpool's mouth than the air
    nearby begins to glow and shimmer.

    AUTHORITY (TVA). Upgraded since we last saw them in `Loki.'

    FULLY ARMORED and WIELDING TIMESTICKS. Ready for action.

    The Minutemen take an aggressive posture. We see Deadpool pop
    his head out like a gopher from behind the hill. He
    disappears down below and yells from behind the knoll:

              But I promise not to use them.

    Deadpool turns to camera and addresses us directly.

    Deadpool snaps off one of WOLVERINE's ADAMANTIUM RIB BONES.

    He throws it violently toward an approaching soldier. We
    track it through the air and see it's engraved with "The
    Marvel Cinematic Universe Presents."

    Every few strikes we speed-ramp down so we can read the
    various bones entering bodies of screaming Minutemen. An
    adamantium tibia breaks through a chest plate. As it
    disappears into his body, we read, "A film by Shawn Levy".
    Yup... Wolverine's bones and the carnage they wreak are also

     Mr. Paradox waves to monitors filled with incredible scenes
     from classic MCU movies. Iron Man faces Iron Monger in Iron
     Man. Hawkeye drops Natasha to her death in Endgame. The
     airport battle from Civil War.

     And right there in the middle of the action, kicking an
     unholy amount of ass, is CAPTAIN AMERICA himself. Fighting
     WINTER SOLDIER. Beating the shit out of IRON MAN, etc.

      DEADPOOL flies in backwards, continuing the momentum from
      "Hopper-rene", taking out a patron's beer. He rolls up and
      onto his feet. The PATRON takes an aggressive SWING. Deadpool
      very nonchalantly - almost elegantly - catches the man by the

     Lowlifes inhabit the corners. Deadpool scans the room, his
     eyes landing on a lone figure slumped at the end of the bar.
     The silhouette of his hairstyle leaves no room for ambiguity
     about who this solitary figure is.

     The CARAVAN approaches the MASSIVE CARCASS of a GIANT
<b>     SKELETON.
</b>
     The humongous body lays on its stomach, its skeletal CHIN
     resting on the ground. Its arms extend in front of it,
     creating a massive ARENA-LIKE CIRCLE, its TWO GIANT GLOVED
     HANDS overlapping to form a GATE.

     As the CARAVAN APPROACHES, the MASSIVE HANDS begin to part.
     The "gate" opens, a mechanical pulley-system being operated
     by the BLOB atop the rampart.

     The PRISON TRUCK pulls in. There is a hive of activity.
     Henchmen eye our heroes suspiciously. Among them is a massive
     JUGGERNAUT VARIANT, complete with a Vinnie Jones-style
     Helmet.

     Jonathan gets yanked out and flung on the ground. Deadpool
     and Wolverine get shoved out of the cage into the "arena" of
     the GIANT SKELETAL arms. Wolverine lands on top of Deadpool,
     repaying the Headbutt. OTHER HENCHMEN shove the other
     prisoner from inside the other cage-ball-- who we now notice
     is the Minuteman Deadpool made self-prune in the Logan grave
     fight sequence!-- onto the ground. A HORN rings out. The
     CROWD goes silent.

     Then movement and a groaning creak from the Giant Skeletal
     head, as the mask rises, revealing the rotted carcass of a
     skull inside.

     Out of the darkness of the skull's jaw, an old, decrepit
     figure wheels out on an ALL-TOO-FAMILIAR WHEEL CHAIR. The
     figure's head is turned down, obscuring their face but
     revealing a BALD-HEAD.

     The bald head rises, revealing the sweet smile of CASSANDRA
     NOVA. In silhouette, she's the mirror-image of Charles
     Xavier.

     Cassandra rolls forward in the rickety, battle-damaged and
     BLOOD-STAINED wheelchair. She comes to a stop, then stands up
     and walks down from the giant skull toward our heroes.

     Wolverine LUNGES at Cassandra. Cassandra stops him in his
     tracks and then, with a wave, flings him back and into the
     ground. Buried alive.

     His SIX-CLAWS poke up out of the ground, the only part of him
     still visible. Cassandra motions again, and the claws cut
     through the ground as the subterranean Logan is shoved away.

     We see KALEIDOSCOPIC FLASHES of Deadpool/Wade from the first
     two movies; images of heroism, joy, connection. The images
     swirl into a flashback of BUSTER KEATON, saying the words
     that will break Wade's heart. Another shot shows us HAROLD
     LLOYD escorting Wade out. We hold on Wade's crestfallen
     visage as the door closes behind him. Then we see Wade
     staring at his Deadpool suit, eyes listless. Then in his new
     uniform at DriveMax. We see him standing outside in the
     middle of the car lot. Sad. Lost.

     Deadpool and Wolvie, on high alert, turn towards the threat.

     Cresting the hill, bathed in slow motion and silhouetted,
     bounds an animal. Smallish, maybe 10 to 20 pounds.

     What comes into view is unexpected in every way. It's a dog.
     Wearing a Deadpool suit. But not just any dog:

     The UGLIEST MOTHER-FUCKING DOG ON THE PLANET.

<b>     DOGPOOL!

     Slow motion. Cue: Chris De Burgh's song, "LADY IN RED".

     Close on Dogpool, tongue hanging out the side of its mouth.
     One of its eyes is milky white while the other wanders in no
     particular direction. What little fur it possesses sprouts
     disdainfully from its weird head.

     Needless to say, Deadpool is SMITTEN instantly. Deadpool

     extends his arms. Sincere musical swells are fucking
     everywhere. The dog continues charging towards Wade and leaps
     into his arms. She bathes Wade's face in a hideous cocktail
     of saliva from a cankerous tongue. The music climaxes as
     DOGPOOL and Wade kiss in ecstasy. We hard cut out to:

</b>               Sorry! Sorry `bout that! Come here,

     Wade and Wolverine watch as a man crests the hill. He's
     immaculate. He wears a Deadpool suit with no mask. The suit
     looks like Yves Saint Laurent himself slummed it and designed
     a Marvel film. The man's about twenty-percent more muscular
     and after a pretty healthy session in Lola, looks like a
     younger RYAN REYNOLDS in his prime before his looks were
     ravaged by four children and ten side hustles. The man's a
     goddamn angel.

               But in here, everybody calls me
               Nicepool. Or Wendy. Oh my goodness,
               wait `til you see LadyPool! She is

               and you can't even tell.

               say that.

<b>                         NICEPOOL
</b>               That's okay. I identify as a
               feminist.

               one second and she starts shopping
               for a new papa.

     Dogpool rests comfortably in Wade's arms. While Wade
     converses, the dog intermittently licks the inside of his
     mouth. It's both horrifying and vaguely intimate. Everyone is
     uncomfortable. Especially the actor playing Wade.

               Sling Blade. Hit me again?

               really, really want them to, but it
               never quite worked out?

     Gatsby charges and FLICKS A CARD. It nearly takes off
     Deadpool's HEAD, and SLICES THROUGH WOLVERINE'S BOTTLE OF
     BOOZE. Cutting it in half, perfectly, before exploding
     against the wall. A shit-faced Wolvie barely acknowledges,
     reaching for another bottle nearby.

                to call her, Dogpool. You want to
                treat yourself to a little stroke?
                Get the tongue.

                fucked a gremlin. Angrily. In a bed
                of gonorrhea. And didn't stop until
                the sun came up.

</b><b>      OUR SONG CONTINUES:
</b>      TIGHT ON WADE looking wistful. Grateful. We see what he's
      looking at. His world. His universe... AKA: His friends.

      Everyone from his birthday party is here. Over music, we see
      Wade and Vanessa lock eyes. The chasm between them, perhaps a
      little closer now. A flicker of hope. He continues looking at
      her as Dogpool's tongue explores the inside of Wade's mouth.
      As the camera pans across everyone's faces, we see the
      relaxed joy among these pals.

      Deadpool is watching the bank of monitors in the TVA Control
      Room. He's focussed on one specific camera: The PRISON TRUCK
      with Jonathan, Deadpool, and Wolverine.

      It's the footage from the CCTV camera inside the spherical
      prison cell. It's grainy, but we can clearly see and hear
      Jonathan.
