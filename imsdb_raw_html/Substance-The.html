<b>    FADE IN ON A HIGH ANGLE TOP SHOT OF...
</b>
<b>    A RAW, UNCOOKED EGG LYING ON A FLAT SURFACE.
</b>    The round yolk stands proudly in the center of the
    transparent and gelatinous egg white.

    A syringe needle enters the frame and slowly approaches the
    egg before planting itself in the middle of the yolk and very
    slowly injects a fluorescent yellow product inside of it.

    After a moment, the egg begins to shake and move as if
    something were happening inside of it.

    Little by little, a small growth begins to emerge on the side
    of the yolk... which grows bigger... and bigger... until it
    starts to form a second egg yolk which emerges out of the
    side of the first one... before finally detaching itself to
    become independent.

    Both egg yolks now stand side by side.

    The second yolk is rounder, shinier, fleshier.

    In other words: more perfect.

    Long beat on both egg yolks which stand side by side.

<b>    BLACK
</b>

    The sounds of jackhammers, traffic jams, jigsaws, coming from
    a construction site in the middle of the city...

    We FADE IN on a STATIC TOP SHOT OF...


<b>    EXT. WALK OF FAME SIDEWALK - DAY
</b>
    A SIDEWALK MADE UP OF LARGE GREY SLABS. Only one slab appears
    to be missing like a big gaping hole right in the middle of
    the pavement.

    In the same static shot, WORKER'S HANDS appear within the
    frame and start to carefully set in place thin sticks of
    wood, nailing them to one another.

    The linked sticks soon form a wooden frame shaped like a star
    which stands out in the muddy hole of the pavement.

    Little by little, the hands start to place various different
    elements inside the star shaped frame: brass block letters
    which begin to form a name: E...L...I...Z...A...B...E...T...H... S...P...A...R...K...L...E
    Underneath, the small round crest containing the logo of a
    camera appears.





A pink marble slab slides into the golden edges of the wooden
frame... sealing the pink star into the terrazzo pavement
which we now understand to be the famous HOLLYWOOD WALK OF
<b>FAME.
</b>
Still in the same static shot with the star in the center of
the frame, workers' hands come in and out making final
tweaks, then remove the plastic protective film. A broom
sweeps back and forth shining up the now finished star - in
the middle of which the golden inscription proudly stands:


<b>                                   ELISABETH SPARKLE
</b>

After a moment, still in the same shot, a buzz of excitement
from the crowd and camera flashes start to multiply as the
feet of a YOUNG WOMAN enter the bottom of the frame. Wearing
vertiginously high heels and with a conquering walk, she
poses for the cameras before kneeling down and placing her
hands underneath the star.

More flashes and voices trying to attract the attention of
the lucky lady: "Elisabeth!" "Over here Elisabeth!""Right
here Elisabeth!".

The flurry of feet around the high heels and the way they
move tells a story of their own: flattery, fawning,
happiness, recognition, ambition, success etc.

Then the young woman's feet and those of the crowd gradually
disappear one by one, just like the camera flashes, which
also grow rare and finally disappear, leaving the static
frame empty and silent, with only the star and its name:


<b>                                   ELISABETH SPARKLE
</b>

After a long beat on the star and still in the same shot, a
leaf flies across the screen, the wind brushing it past.

Then the feet of passersby which enter and exit the frame,
walking across the star in a pace that quickens as the days
go by and life carries on.

More and more feet enter and exit. A few marks and scratches
appear on the star, the concrete aging little by little as
time goes by, to the pace of more walking, more pedestrians,
tourists, alternating rain and sun, changing fashions,
pigeons landing on the ground, shopping carts being pulled
over it in an uninterrupted flow of everyday foot traffic.

Some feet occasionally stop to look down at Elisabeth's star,
then less and less, then almost none at all as we notice new
stars appearing at the corners of the frame, which start
drawing people's attention away.



<b>                                                              -3-

                                                           ...sc 2


    Finally, the white sneakers of a tourist wearing shorts that
    walk lazily across the now worn and patinated star, clumsily
    dropping a round burger bun, which falls on the ground,
    smearing the star with a large ketchup stain.

    The guy lowers his hand in a half-hearted attempt to clean up
    the stain with a greasy piece of burger paper, then with the
    big sole of his sneaker, thus leaving a large, disgusting red
    trail across the star. The feet walk out of the frame,
    helplessly, above all showing very little interest in
    cleaning the whole thing up.

    The star remains in the center, now aged and stained with the
    red ketchup:


<b>                                       ELISABETH SPARKLE
</b>

    Long beat over which we hear the aggressive and exhausting
    cacophony of traffic then, little by little, music is heard
    in the distance, stressed by the dynamic accents of a female
    voice growing louder and clearer:

    Keep moving! That's great! YOU GOT IT!

    Walk it back! Couple more! YOU GOT IT!

    Again from the very top!

    A small blinking red dot indicates that this is being filmed
    and recorded.

    We're inside a TV Studio, in the very middle of an aerobics
    class.

    Lights full on and flashy-colored aerobic outfits.

    Fluorescent leotards.

    Muscles tightening under each step.

    Ultra forced smiles.

    Super happy music broadcasting ready-made happiness.

In the foreground of this fluorescent group, high on
vitamins, ELISABETH SPARKLE, now close to fifty, leads the
class, with a wide, bright smile.

Her ultra-sculpted body strictly primed against the smallest
bit of flab or excess.

In the background, a large morning show title is visible:

<b>                               SPARKLE YOUR LIFE
</b>                                   With Elisabeth


Keep moving! That's great! You got it!

All the pairs of fluorescent leggings beat up and down in
rhythm like perfect soldiers and Elisabeth never stops
smiling as if her bright smile were etched to her jaw while
she motivates her audience with an energetic voice:

<b>                          ELISABETH
</b>                I know it's hard! Walk it back!

                Think about your bikini this
                summer! You don't want to look like
                a giant jellyfish on the beach, do
                you? So keep moving! Couple more...
                we're almost there... aaand...

The music ends on a final synchronized movement made by all
the dancers.

<b>                          ELISABETH (CONT'D)
</b>                ... give yourselves a hand! That
                was a GREAT workout!

The troupe applauds while Elisabeth faces the camera with a
great big smile:

<b>                          ELISABETH (CONT'D)
</b>                I'll see you next week to work more
                on the lateral abs, those are the
                hardest to sculpt. In the
                meantime... Take care of yourself!

She blows a kiss to the camera.

The cameras stop rolling, and the soundstage lights fade.

Elisabeth's smile fades instantly as she relaxes her body.

She's covered in sweat. Out of breath.

Really out of breath. She winces briefly as she massages her
knee.

An assistant brings her a towel and a bottle of water.




    We follow her from behind...

</b><b>    INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY
</b>    ...as she walks down the long backstage corridor of the tv
    station with an energetic stride.

    EVERYONE she meets or bumps into wishes her a "Happy
    Birthday" with a broad smile. Elisabeth smiles back and
    cheerfully thanks them.

    Walking down the corridor she passes by dozens of framed
    posters displaying her smiling face and shapely body from
    every season of the show:

<b>                                       SPARKLE YOUR LIFE
</b>
    On the successive posters, Elisabeth displays the exact same
    bright smile but the colors and looks change as her physical
    appearance alters over time, the hairstyles becoming less and
    less frizzed and her face more and more photoshopped.

    Elisabeth walks to the ladies room at the end of the corridor
    but it turns out to be closed for cleaning. She glances round
    to check she's alone and finally... walks into the men's room
    next door.

    Nobody inside.

    She leans over the sink, splashes water over her face, making
    the most of the moment to refresh herself after the physical
    effort.

    She then enters one of the toilet stalls.

    Static shot of the row of sinks in the empty men's room.

    The neons cast a perfectly white and unchanging light.

    Long, silent beat.

    Soon to be broken by the sudden, loud arrival of A STOUT
    MIDDLE-AGED MAN, his ear glued to a cellphone, face red with
    anger:

This is HARVEY, the TV network director. Mid-50s, large belly
and wearing a loose suit, he comes to stand right in front of
the camera under which we guess is an out of frame urinal.
His phone wedged between his ear and shoulder he continues
his logorrhoea while unbuttoning his pants to take a piss:

                    (the person at the other
                     end of the line tries to
                     say something but is
                     immediately cut off)

                I don't give a fuck what we
                promised her! This is TV, not a
                charity! So find me somebody NEW.

He flushes the urinal and closes his fly.

He leaves without washing his hands....

His voice drifts away as the bathroom door slowly closes with
the automatic closing system.

<b>                               HARVEY (CONT'D)

His laughter trailing off in the distance until the room is
completely silent again.

A beat on the empty room.

The white sinks.

The neon lights casting the unchanging light.

Then, the sound of a toilet flushing.

The door to one of the stalls finally opens slowly and
Elisabeth walks out.

She remains still for a moment in the middle of the
immaculate room, her reflection infinitely repeating in the
mirrors in front and behind her.

    Her fluorescent leggings now seem ridiculously out of place.

    She walks very calmly towards a sink, washes her hands slowly
    and knowingly, her eyes focused on the water flowing out of
    the tap... then she stops the water in one swift gesture.

    She looks up slowly...

    A beat, alone, facing her reflection in the mirror...

</b>    Greasy fingers that rip the head off of a shrimp: SHLACK!

    The thick sweaty nape of a man's neck, on which a fly
    sporadically lands. A pudgy hand tries to flick it away.

    It's Harvey's hand. Facing camera, he is in the midst of
    another logorrheic monologue as he peels and shells the juicy
    shrimp before stuffing them into his mouth...slurp...in
    between two words...

                    rather talk about RENOIR or GAUGUIN
                    but slurp... that's how it is.
                    C'est la vie... People are just...
                    people. And I have to give people
                    what they want. slurp... That's
                    what keeps the shareholders happy.
                    slurp... And let me tell you
                    something: people always ask for
                    something NEW. slurp... RENEWAL is
                    inevitable. It's nature's way. You
                    either RENEW or you disappear.

    "RENEW" seems to explode out of his mouth in a splutter of
    shrimp.

    He stares at a young waitress' ass, which seems to RENEW his
    appetite.

with his hand...

Then he brushes it all aside with a sweeping gesture.

A tiny, empty beat in Harvey's dull eyes.

He jumps to his feet grabbing his phone, looking terribly
busy, and calls out to a MAN (60) at the back of the room.

He walks away, hitting on the young waitress as he passes her
by and opening his arms towards a man in his sixties at the
back of the room, grandiloquent:

Inside the wine glass, which she's barely touched, the fly is
drowning. It's wriggling all around desperately fighting to
escape this sweet, liquid trap...

He separates the open flaps of her paper hospital gown and
places his stethoscope on her back.

While he moves the stethoscope around her back, we notice
that he has a small strawberry birthmark on his forearm.

We hear noises coming from inside her body, amplified by the
instrument: Boom boom... boom boom...boom boom....

His hands start to palpate along her backbone, the fingers of
his latex gloves following the length of the prominent
vertebrae, stopping and palpating each vertebra with great
attention, as if his probing fingers were measuring the
resistance of her spinal column.

</b>     Elisabeth is standing in front of an oversized picture window
     with a magnificent view of the city in a spacious, elegantly
     decorated living room.

     Hanging on the wall opposite the window is a huge full-length
     framed poster of her. She's sporting a sexy pose in a blue
     leotard with a big conquering smile on her face.

     A bouquet of flowers still wrapped in plastic sits on the
     table. On the small card attached we read: "Thank you for all
     these years with us. You were amazing!". The word "were"
     seems to stand out like a punch in the face.

     Elisabeth plugs the USB stick into her television screen and
     sits on the couch.

     Underneath a very slight, almost inaudible crackling sound.

     Have you ever dreamt of a better version of yourself?

     The screen remains completely black as the voice continues:

     We are merely the expression of a genetic code that freezes
     at a precise moment.

     But your DNA conceals billions of other possibilities.

Inside of you, there is another you. Or should I say,
billions of other "yous."

One single injection unlocks your DNA, starting a new
cellular division, that will release another version of
yourself.

Younger. More beautiful. More perfect.

This is...

The title appears full screen at the same time as the voice
pronounces:



<b>        THE SUBSTANCE
</b>A long silent beat over the title.

It then disappears. Silent beat on the BLACK screen.

And at long last, an image...

A yellow ball (like blu tack) upon a white surface
(high angle top shot like in a lab demonstration).

You are the matrix.
The ball is slightly dented and irregular.

Two male hands enter the frame and start slowly pulling on a
section of the blu tack ball.

Everything comes from YOU.

The hand pulls... and pulls... until the piece detaches
itself from the original ball.

And everything IS you.

<b>THE HAND ROLLS THE NEW PIECE TO FORM A PERFECTLY ROUNDED
</b><b>SECOND BALL WHICH NOW SITS NEXT TO THE ORIGINAL, THAT IN
</b><b>CONTRAST SEEMS ALL THE MORE IMPERFECT.

This is simply... a better version of yourself.

Each hand presents one ball on its open palm:

You just have to share.

The left hand closes over the left ball making it disappear.

One week for one.

     And one week for the other.

     Both hands re-open. Silent beat on the two small balls side
     by side.

     A perfect balance of 7 days each.

      run; she stares for a moment at her reflection in the mirror.

      The lights continue to shine. The world continues to spin.

      Without her.

      Her eyes dart back and forth between different objects and
      keepsakes lined up on the edge of the window sill. An Oscar
      has pride of place among the other statues and awards, framed
      photos and souvenirs where we see her smiling surrounded by
      various people.

      She picks up a snow globe with a small figurine version of
      herself inside. The tiny figurine stands on a small pink
      star, a replica of the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

      She shakes the globe: golden confetti floats around inside
      the liquid, creating a magical golden rain around Elisabeth's
      figurine replica.

      A suspended moment on the sparkling confetti lingering
      weightlessly...

      All of a sudden, Elisabeth turns around and hurls the globe
      with all her strength against the wall: BAM!!! The globe
      smashes and shatters into pieces against the framed poster,
      splattering everything in the process.

      The smiling face on the poster is now dribbling the slimy,
      transparent liquid; the glass is cracked right over one of
      her eyes, as if she had gotten punched in the face.

</b>      Elisabeth, naked, faces her bathroom mirror.

      She looks at the sight the mirror reflects back at her
      without clothing and makeup.

      Her breasts. Her belly. Her face.

      She slides her hand over her beauty mark with its singular
      shape next to her belly button.

      She's still a very beautiful woman but doesn't seem happy by
      what she sees. We can sense a hidden anguish. Generalized.
      Immense.

      Basically she's just aging... and everything and everyone
      around her leads her to believe it is the end of the world.
      The end of her world.

      As she looks at her reflection in the mirror, we hear the
      man's deep resonating voice:

      You are the matrix.

      On the side of the sink, the equipment is carefully placed
      upon a small silver tray.

      Everything comes from YOU.

      And everything IS YOU.

      She picks up the syringe and fills it with the fluorescent
      yellow liquid from the small ACTIVATOR vial.

      This is simply... a better version of yourself.

      She looks at herself in the mirror again.

      Then she takes the tourniquet strap provided with her kit.

      She makes a tourniquet on her arm, which she tightens with
      her teeth.

      She disinfects her arm with a cotton pad soaked in alcohol.

      She taps her forearm to find a vein.

      We can sense she's nervous. She ends up taking a deep breath,
      sinks the needle into the vein and slowly empties the
      contents of the syringe.

      She waits for a few moments, tensed.

      Nothing happens.

      A beat. She breathes in deeply.

      Still nothing.

      She sighs... This is bullshi-

      She turns away from the mirror and everything suddenly starts
      spinning. She falls...

      She's folded in two on the floor, violent abdominal pains
      shooting straight through her stomach. The pain is
      excruciating.

      Her skin seems to come alive all of a sudden. As if something
      were growing and moving underneath it.

      Sounds grow muffled. As if she were hearing inside of
      herself. There is something moving... evolving...

      Extreme close up of her pupil dilating...

      ...Deforming...

      ...DIVIDING ITSELF INTO TWO inside her iris...

      She curls up into a foetal position under the unbearable
      pain.

      Her eye rolls upwards and for a moment we fleetingly see... A
      SECOND EYE INSIDE THE CAVITY before it disappears behind the
      ocular globe...

      On her back, her skin deforms itself and then starts rippling
      like waves, as if something strange were moving inside of
      her.

      The skin covering her spine starts to crack... and split
      open. Under the opening skin... we see a SECOND SPINE...

      As if ANOTHER BODY were locked up inside her own body.

      The skin parts in two and lets THE SECOND BODY APPEAR.

      The sound is muffled, her pupil dilates like a black hole, a
      ringing noise creeps up in her ears, growing more and more
      deafening...

      We enter her pupil, a tunnel of fluorescent light moving at
      full speed towards a small white spot which grows bigger and
      bigger with AMAZING SPEED...

Flickering like the batting of eyelids...

Slowly coming back to life...

At first we only see white tiles.

We soon realize that this is Elisabeth's POV, waking up on
the bathroom floor. Her vision is blurry, she is trying to
focus...

She turns to the other side and sees...

Elisabeth... lying on her back, unconscious on the white
tiles.

<b>... ?
</b>
If Elisabeth is lying down on the ground in front of her...
Who is she??

Her POV: She lifts up her hand into her field of vision. The
nerve network is still being constructed making its blue
veins bulge slightly. The edges of her fingernails perspire a
mixture of fluid and blood.

She heads towards the sink and faces the steamed up mirror.
She attempts to focus. She wipes the mirror with her hand to
take the condensation away and discovers... A MAGNIFICENT
YOUNG WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES... perfectly formed... incredibly
beautiful... and young.

Her features are different from Elisabeth's, but there is a
distant family resemblance.

She looks completely dazed.

All the sounds are muffled as if she were in cotton wool. As
if she can hear the inside of her body.

She approaches the mirror to look at her eye. She pulls down
her lower eyelid: inside of her iris, traces of yellow
fluorescent pigment are resorbing and forming a few small,
irregular yellow stains.

She slides her hand over her face, her hard nipples, filled
with life... Super hard pointy nipples like when she was
twenty.

She notices that her singular beauty mark is now on her right
breast, while her tummy is unblemished.

She turns to one side, exaggerates the curve of her back upon
which her long hair cascades down... like a Venus emerging
from the water... a creature of almost supernatural beauty.

She looks down... and sees her old self lying on the floor.

The matrix.

      ...in a puddle of fluid and blood.

      The matrix's back along her spine shows the traces of a slot-
      like opening, already half closed.

      As if the shock of this vision were too violent for her,
      everything spins and she throws up a yellow, fluorescent
      liquid on the white tiled floor.

      She then tries to get ahold of herself... the matrix is pale
      and can't seem to breathe anymore.

</b>      She opens up the sewing kit and forces herself to get it
      together. She starts sewing up the slit in Elisabeth's back.

      The needle and thread start suturing the huge wound along her
      spine...

      Once the suturing is finished, she picks up the perfusion bag
      upon which is written:"FOOD/MATRIX" and sticks the
      intravenous needle into Elisabeth's arm.

      A small bubble floats up through the perfusion pipe...

      thick yellow liquid begins to empty very slowly along the

      She takes out of the kit: a long puncture needle... and a
      sort of plastic tube containing individual, but interlocking,
      mini-vials (clipped on the inside) numbered 1 to 7, making up
      the whole of a compartmentalized syringe.

      She looks at the instruction card... her eyebrows shoot up
      when she sees the diagrams, a bit uneasy...

      Ping, ping, ping, the drops of blood fall more quickly and
      persistently forcing her to react.

      She kneels down next to the matrix and gently turns her onto
      her side.

      She approaches the oversized needle... and starts lightly
      jabbing the sutured skin... it resists... she pushes with a
      bit more strength... it still resists... she pushes again
      and... Swik!... it slides right in.

      Extremely concentrated while trying to ignore the piercing
      tinnitus that never stops, her eyes watch the long puncture
      needle that progressively sinks into the spinal column.

      The needle all the way in, she clips on the series of
      compartmentalized vials (forming a barrel) and pulls lightly
      on the plunger... progressively draining a transparent liquid
      and filling the individual vials.

      Once all the vials are filled, she carefully removes the
      needle, unclips the first vial marked DAY 1 and Swik! Gives
      herself an intramuscular injection in the thigh.

      HER PUPIL DILATES - A beat while her body diffuses the
      fluid.... the tinnitus diminishes in intensity... and finally
      disappears.

      The bleeding has stopped. Everything's ok.

      She breathes out to calm herself

      But she's distracted by a noise...

      She strains her ears... is it the... sound... of...

<b>      A KEY IN THE LOCK??!!

      After a suspended moment where everything freezes, her mind
      processing the information...

      throws all her weight against it, violently slamming it back
      shut on the person who was trying to get in. She double locks
      the door. CLICK- CLACK.

      After a beat to collect her wits, she looks through the
      peephole and discovers: MARIA, her bag toppled over on the
      floor, not understanding what has just happened...

      through her coat pocket, takes out her phone and writes a

      NewElisabeth, in panties and t-shirt, faces the picture
      window overlooking the city.

      She turns around and looks at the big framed photo of
      Elisabeth hanging on the wall, frozen in her blue leotard and
      imperturbable smile.

      She goes to stand in the middle of the room.

      A beat standing completely still.

      Then, perfectly straight on her central axis, she starts
      sliding her two legs apart... her feet slowly sliding in
      opposite directions on the hardwood floor... even more, until
      she is in a full split with what seems to be disconcerting
      ease.

      Her knee no longer troubles her in the least.

      She then turns into a straddle split position and leans her
      torso forward, easily reaching the floor with her nose, arms
      extended.

      LOW ANGLE SHOT of the poster of Elisabeth on the wall... soon
      to be blocked out by NewElisabeth's upper body reappearing in
      the frame while she straightens back up.

      She leans her torso to one side, making Elisabeth's smiling
      face reappear behind her... then returns to her central axis,
      masking Elisabeth's face again, before leaning over to the
      other side... like a metronome covering and uncovering
      Elisabeth's image to the rhythm of her stretching routine.

      A beat. And the her eyes fall upon the wastepaper basket with
      the newspaper thrown by Elisabeth before.

      Her mustard yellow coat pulled tightly around her waist, but
      the coat is now too big for her new, thinner and slender
      frame, giving her a shapeless silhouette.

      Her step is unsteady, very much aware of all the surrounding

      The sound of her steps on the pavement.

      Everything seems sharper. Heightened.

     On the bathroom cabinet shelf, the syringe's
     compartmentalized barrel is now empty, the seven vials have
     been used.

     Sue looks at herself in the mirror.

     from the intravenous tubing... clips on the end of the small
     pipe instead... and sticks the needle at the other end of the
     pipe into her own arm.

     She's a little nervous...

     She waits... lightly twists and turns the needle inside her
     arm... After a short moment, blood starts to run through the
     transparent nozzle on one side, and then the other; blood
     starts to circulate between the two bodies.

     Little by little, her vision blurs. As if life were leaving
     her body. As if she could feel the cold void of emptiness
     invade and overwhelm her. As if the world were losing its
     colors. And life its very spark.

     All of a sudden, everything starts to distort HORRIBLY, her

     She starts coughing uncontrollably. Like a fish straight out
     of the water whose gills have difficulty functioning.

     Sue's lifeless body has collapsed right on top of her, which
     prevents Elisabeth from breathing. She tries several times
     before finally being able to make her roll over. Elisabeth
     stays in place for a moment, trying to catch her breath.

     She removes the small pipe from her arm and gets up with
     difficulty.

     She staggers abruptly as if her muscles were weakened. She
     regains her balance at the very last moment and leans against
     the sink.

     She looks at her reflection in the mirror. She looks like a
     trainwreck. Her mouth is sticky and dry. Her eyelashes are
     stuck together. She rubs her painful knee and just stands
     there for a moment, head hanging down.

     She twists and turns to look at the scar on her back. The
     stitches outline a long gash going down her spinal column
     from her neck all the way to her tailbone.

     She puts on her bathrobe. Tightens the belt around her waist.

     She's freezing. As if she were awakening from a heroin shot.

     She looks down at Sue's body on the floor.

     So perfect.

     It's the first time that she sees her � that she sees

     pointless, now it's as though a bundle of irrepressible

     Sue walks into the living room and sees that the TV is still
     switched on. Her gaze falls upon the large armchair facing
     the TV with a slight concave impression in the cushion...

     A barely perceptible scolding look flashes across her face.

      She walks towards the picture window - a post-it note is
      stuck on it:

                            Too drunk to take the bike home,
                                 keep an eye on her ;)

</b>
      Elisabeth reaches out to grab the post-it note AND SHE
      IMMEDIATELY RETRACTS HER HAND as if she'd seen something
      awful, something frightening...

      She slowly lifts her hand into her field of vision...and in
      complete shock she sees...

      ...her finger.

      Her index finger is crooked and swollen, deformed with
      arthritis... her fingernail is yellow and the skin withered
      like an old woman's finger - while the rest of her hand is
      normal.

      The horribly withered skin.

      The protruding and swollen blue veins.

      The deformed knuckles.

      She closes her eyes, tensing her face...and her expression
      hardens as what happened becomes progressively clear to her.

      She looks at Sue's body on the floor.

      The stranded empty vial next to her.

      She lowers the back of her bathrobe and twists around, trying
      to see the reflection of her back in the mirror.

      The puncture site is red, slightly swollen... and ouch...
      painful to touch.

      She closes her eyes a moment, her hand clinging to the sink's
      edge, with this deformed finger that stands out against the

She empties the glasses and the ashtrays.

She goes to the picture window, rips off the post-it note.

      THE GNARLED FINGER ON THE TOOTHBRUSH brushing back and
      forth... mixing saliva and toothpaste... brush up... brush
      down... up... down. Elisabeth lost in her thoughts...

      She gargles, spits and puts the toothbrush back in its glass.
      She picks up her night cream in a well-rehearsed ritual.

      She puts it on her face, still absorbed in her thoughts as
      the white cream penetrates her skin;

      She puts the cover back on the jar of cream and is about to
      put it back in place on the shelf... when she stops... she
      looks at the jar and focuses on the inscription:

      She slowly unscrews the jar top and stares at the glossy
      white cream inside...

      And then slowly, takes her crooked finger and progressively
      dips it into the cream... She sticks her finger all the way
      in until it is completely covered.

      She waits for a moment... carefully turning her finger in the
      white cream... and then slowly removing it; the finger now
      entirely covered in glistening white cream as though it was a
      poultice covering the skin.

      With her other hand she searches through the small cabinet
      and takes out a crepe bandage, which she wraps and knots
      around the cream-covered finger.

      Like a little doll in a cocoon at the end of her hand.

      She presses lightly on the doll... which oozes cream.

      Good. It's soaking in.

falls to the ground. As he leans over to pick it up,
Elisabeth glimpses on the nape of his neck... the beginning
of a thick pink scar similar to her own, which disappears
under his shirt collar... He gathers up all the credit cards
that have scattered on the floor: among them is a white
plastic card with 207 on it. He puts it away in his wallet
and sits back up.

      And the lipstick is all wrong. She takes it off and puts on
      another.

      She adds more blush. Brush strokes to her cheekbones, in an

contracting to the music.

She loses her balance, almost falling over. A dancer catches
her just in time. Everybody stops.

The music stops, again. The cameras stop.

This time everybody is a little bewildered.

Everyone gets back in position. The cameras. The assistant

Sue gives a questioning glance: what's going on?

She sees the crew bustling about... Someone is giving
instructions through a walkie-talkie. The info is passed from
person to person, walkie-talkie to walkie-talkie.

Sue turns and sees that it's the camera... that is just
behind her ass.

Her stress level is rising... she pulls down on her leotard
bottom to better cover her ass, but the cut of the fabric
just won't allow for it.

Sue keeps her back close to the wall so that nobody can see
her ass in case the bulge returns.

      They have started the replay: on a giant screen at the back
      of the scenery, images of the troop rewind at top speed,
      making them look like ridiculous little marionettes shaking
      their legs and asses.

      The video comes to a close up shot of Sue's ass.

      She's increasingly nervous as the control room gives the time
      code for the problematic frame while everyone is watching her
      ass, frame by frame on the giant screen...

      Sue's assistant finally returns with her cover up, which she
      throws on nervously before suddenly rushing down the hallway.

      She comes to her dressing room, shuts herself inside and
      looks in the mirror.

      Slowly, she lifts the fabric of her leotard to discover...
      the bulge which has returned to the same spot as in the
      shower earlier... but bigger and uglier this time.

      What the hell...

      It's like an internal growth that is deforming her butt
      cheek... as though something were stuck under her skin.

      She lightly presses on the bulge and realizes that she can...
      move it... she pushes and palpates all around it... and with
      a small suction noise the bulge starts slowly moving under
      her skin - up her buttock and towards her waist.

      She doesn't even answer. She is completely obsessed with the
      mass under her skin, which she pushes between her fingers
      sliding it around.

      ...the fatty lump moves slowly under her skin towards her
      waist...

      she pushes it again, guiding it around to her stomach...

      An empty pint of ice cream. Chocolate bars recklessly munched
      down to the last square.

      Traces of greasy fingerprints on the TV remote control.

A beat.

If you don't want extra time you simply have to stop taking
it.

Elisabeth makes a dreadful grimace, closing her eyes,
struggling against her impulse to implode.

ALL DECISIONS ARE YOUR DECISIONS. You're simply making them
from different sides of yourself.

Everything is getting all too Kafkaesque...

Would you like to stop?

Elisabeth is taken aback.

You are the Matrix. Your other side depends on you to survive
but you don't. If you are not satisfied, you can put an end
to the experience whenever you want, and go back to being
just you on your own.

A moment of silence. Then again, like a mantra:

Would you like to stop? To go back to being just you on your
own?

Elisabeth seems lost...wrapping her bathrobe tighter around
herself.

We feel all of her vulnerability as she waits for the answer.

The line crackles.

What has been transferred won't come back.

We have made that clear already.

But you can stop the experience as of now.

A beat.

Would you like to stop? To go back to being just you on your
own?

Her eyes fall upon her horrifically aged leg... then look
beneath her bathrobe, towards what we imagine must be left of
her breasts...

So respect it.

We see her back droop.

Let us know if you need anything else. We will be happy to
answer any of your requests. We are at your disposal.

The line goes dead.

Elisabeth remains slumped over the table.

We can see her stooped back shaken by little hiccups as she
starts sobbing.

THEN: When you're smiling, when you're smiling...

It's Sue's telephone, the Louis Prima ring tone a glaring
reminder of how tragic things have become.

...the whole woooooorld smiles with y-

Her twisted finger pushes a button to send the call direct to
voice mail.

      She stands with difficulty and starts walking away...

      voice mail notification. She hesitates... and can't stop
      herself from going back to listen to it.

      the big armchair.

The TV is on, but she isn't even watching.

She sits silently for a long while, staring into space.

Then something changes in her expression... as though she has
seen something that caught her attention in the bookcase
facing her.

She tries to get up but her aged leg won't straighten... she
is stuck in the big armchair.

A beat. She looks at her severely deformed knee.

Stiff and swollen with arthritis.

She remains in place, staring... tries again to unbend her
leg... we see the intense effort this requires... but her
knee, ravaged by arthritis is blocked in a bent position.

Elisabeth's expression is increasingly harsh as she focuses
on trying to unbend her knee...

She grabs her leg with both hands, trying to force it
straight...but it won't budge...

She pushes harder, harder... She grits her teeth... her
expression betrays increasing agony as she relentlessly tries
to force the knee to unbend...

CRAAAACK - Her kneecap dislocates finally unbending AAAAHHHHH-
a scream of victory and pain.

She does as best she can to push her deformed body to get up -
her dowager's hump is larger and painful, and there's a stain
made by the oozing pus on her bathrobe in the area of the
puncture site.

She limps all the way to the bookcase, leaning on the shelves
to catch her breath, as though she had just run a marathon.

Then her arthritic hand grabs something forgotten that is
stuck between two books: Harvey's departure gift.

She looks at it. Harvey's chubby smiling face appears
superimposed on the wrapping paper.

<b>                          HARVEY

      Sue reaches the restroom and double locks the door.

      After a few seconds, she starts coughing again.

      Once.

      Twice. Ten times.

      She's leaning over the sink; trying to make it stop.

      Cling gling...

      She catches something in the nick of time which has just
      fallen into the sink before it slides down the black hole...

      A silent beat.

      She looks down at her closed fist... which is closed so
      tightly it is almost about to break the cartilage.

      She slowly opens up her fingers...

      And looks down... in the middle of her palm...

      ... at a TOOTH...

      ... Its bloody root...

      She looks down at it...

      And looks back up at the mirror again...

      Slowly... very slowly... she opens up her mouth...

      And discovers... a black hole right in the middle of her
      white teeth...

      She stares for a long moment at her smile in the mirror's
      reflection...

      And as if drawn by an irresistible urge to do so... she
      slowly approaches her fingers towards her other front tooth.

She pulls on it... and the tooth pulls away easily with a
small sticky noise...

Her eyes widen...as she holds this new tooth in between her
fingers...

And as if drawn by another compulsive urge, she touches a
third tooth... which also detaches itself very easily...

Her eyes grow increasingly crazed.

Her toothless smile gets bigger and bigger...

Like the black holes of a harmonica.

A black hole into hell.

She stares down at the three teeth in the palm of her hand.

The enormous and bloody roots... It's as if her hidden dark
side was suddenly coming to light.

Someone knocks at the door.

And suddenly... an idea sparks to life in her eyes...She
looks at her necklace and seems to have come up with an idea.

She rinses her hands and mouth, to get rid of all traces of
blood.

A long silent beat on the star, which seems like a moment of
peace in comparison to the previous images of carnage.

We then see a piece of flesh crawling into the corner of the
frame trying to drag itself over to the star.

In agony, MushofMonstroElisaSue, puts her last efforts into
heaving what remains of her body onto the middle of the star.

She winds up in the middle of the star, looking up at the sky
which grows more and more dazzling as if spotlights were
shining right down on her.

Gold confetti starts to fall from the sky upon her like a
golden rain shower...

Noises of the street and cars muffled little by little, turn
into the sound of applause and grandiloquent music.

MushofMonstroElisaSue watches the confetti fall down on her
monstrous face like in a dream, as if everything were
disappearing around her and she were alone in the world
inside this golden rain.

We can sense that she is utterly happy, as though she were
thoroughly experiencing her moment of accomplishment and
glory as mush on the sidewalk...

The confetti continues to fall as she dissolves more and
more...


<b>  PUDDLEOFMONSTROELIZASUE
</b>...is overwhelmed by the sound of applause... and dissolves
even more until there's now only a large, bloody stain...

Which looks a lot like the splattered ketchup from the
beginning.

A beat.

We hear a roaring sound, which grows louder and louder... as
day breaks...

And a large street cleaning machine with black rotary brushes
glides across the frame, its soapy mouth wiping clean the
traces of blood on the pavement...

BLACK - over which the music from THE TRASH VERSION OF THE
<b>WORLD IS A VAMPIRE BLARES LOUDLY.
