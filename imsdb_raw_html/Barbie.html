</b>

                           Written by

<b>EXT. A DESERT-LIKE-LANDSCAPE. DAY
</b>
Like Kubrick's 2001, but with little girls, not apes. And
with baby dolls, not sticks and stuff.

<b>                    HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)
</b>          Since the beginning of time, since
          the first little girl ever existed,
          there have been dolls.

These little girls rock their baby dolls, they burp them,
they cuddle them: They pretend to be Moms.

<b>                    HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)
</b>          But the dolls were always and
          forever baby dolls. The girls who
          played with them could only ever
          play at being MOTHERS. Which can be
          fun, at least for a while anyway...
          Ask your mother.
              (pause)
          This continued, until...

One of the girls looks UP.

Something has appeared in their midst. Something NEW.
It's a GIANT BARBIE DOLL - BARBIE MARGOT, the 1950s Barbie,
with her black and white swimsuit and lipstick.

The girls react with awe.

They're stirred up   and excited by this Barbie Margot not
unlike the apes in   that Kubrick masterpiece. They try to
touch her, and one   little girl starts smashing her baby doll
against the ground   until it breaks into pieces. She lets out
a child's howl!

One by one the little girls follow suit: whooping, screaming,
throwing their baby dolls away in fits of joyful anger.

A final little girl throws her baby doll up in the air, and
it is spinning, spinning - with a match cut to:



<b>                             BARBIE
</b>


<b>INT. WHITE SPACE
</b>
Barbie stands in a empty space of the soon-to-be formed
Barbie Land - it's a void, a limbo - but clearly in a film
studio. The World of Barbie is a Technicolor Soundstage.
<b>                                                         2.
</b>

<b>                    HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)
</b>          Yes Barbie changed everything! Then
          she changed it all again!

We go through all the changes to Barbie Margot, as she moves
through the decades.

<b>                    HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)
</b>          All of these women are Barbie, and
          Barbie is all of these women. She
          might have started out as just a
          lady in a bathing suit, but she
          became so much more.

We see a row of Barbies. As we move back we see that "Barbie"
is a EVERY different kind of woman -- every profession, every
ethnicity, every body shape, every different ability and
every gift. As we pan by each one, we hear:

<b>                    HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)
</b>          She has her own money, her own
          house, her own car, her own career.
          Because Barbie can be anything,
          women can be anything.


We see a Map with Barbie Land on it and a long red arrow is
drawn across a split screen to the Real World.

<b>                    HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)
</b>              (triumphantly)
          And this has been reflected back
          onto the little girls of today in
          the Real World.

Girls playing with the different dolls. The girls all mirror
what their Barbie is. So the doctor is the doctor, the
ballerina is the ballerina, etc.

<b>                    HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)
</b>          Girls can grow into women who can
          achieve everything and anything
          they set their mind to.

Finally, we see a vast sea of Barbies. All in different
outfits, different hairstyles, adding new friends, speaking
different languages. And now Barbie's world gets continually
multi-faceted and wide-ranging and diverse and interesting.

<b>                    HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)
</b>              (triumphantly)
          Thanks to Barbie all problems of
          feminism and equal rights have been
          solved!
<b>                    (MORE)
</b><b>                                                            3.
</b><b>                    HELEN MIRREN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>              (with a knowing smirk)
          ... at least that's what the
          Barbies think.

We float above the Barbies into the clouds, then we descend
to earth, to see, just below the clouds and above land, the
heart-shaped BARBIE LAND.

<b>                     HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)
</b>          After all they're living in Barbie
          Land. Who am I to burst their
          bubble? And here is one of those
          Barbies now, living her best day
          every day.

<b>INT. BARBIE DREAMHOUSE. BEDROOM. DAY
</b>
Barbie Margot wakes up in her pink Dreamhouse. Everything is
perfect. Of course. This whole sequence is like a movie-
musical of the best life ever.

There are no walls just like the toy so Barbie Margot can
wave across to another Barbie waking up in her Dreamhouse
next door.

In every OTHER Dreamhouse, all the Barbies are having their
perfect morning. It's a Barbie Ballet.

<b>INT. BARBIE DREAMHOUSE. BATHROOM. DAY
</b>
Barbie Margot steps out of her heels, revealing her
permanently arched feet.

Barbie Margot stands under the shower head, but nothing comes
out, she turns her head this way and that, as if there is
water but there is nothing. Her hair looks amazing anyway.

She opens an AMAZING closet and then magically steps out with
a new, perfect outfit!

<b>INT. BARBIE DREAMHOUSE. SLIDE. DAY
</b>
Barbie takes her slide down to the pool. Because she can!

<b>INT. BARBIE DREAMHOUSE. KITCHEN. DAY
</b>
She eats a nothing breakfast, drinks a big glass of nothing.

<b>EXT. BARBIE DREAMHOUSE. DAY
</b>
Barbie Margot stands at the top floor of her house, waves to
her friends and then improbably sails through the air and
lands in the driver's seat of her car.
<b>                                                          4.
</b>

<b>                    HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)
</b>          When you're playing with Barbies
          nobody bothers to walk them down
          the stairs and out the door etc...
          you just pick them up and put them
          where you want them to go -- You
          use your imagination!

Behind her, Barbie Alexandra ALSO sails through the air and
lands in HER dream car.

Barbie Margot drives and waves at Skipper in the doorway of
her treehouse.

Midge appears in Skipper's yard, aggressively waving at
Barbie Margot.

<b>                    HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)
</b>              (butting in)
          Midge was Barbie's pregnant friend.
          Oh let's not show Midge actually...
          she was discontinued by Mattel
          because a pregnant doll is just too
          weird. Anyway... Barbie has another
          BIG day ahead of her.

<b>EXT. BARBIE LAND. DAY
</b>
Barbie Margot waves happily, sometimes with both hands, to
other Barbies as her car silently drives itself through a
bustling town. It's like Richard Scarry's Busy Town for
Barbie. It's a wonder of color and shape. The houses are all
see-through, like the toys, it's a Noah's Ark of doll-tastic
magic.

It's also completely run by women. They hold every kind of
job. Barbie Margot waves to a Barbie mail carrier, and an all
Barbie construction crew. There is the occasional Ken, but
mostly it's Barbie.

Barbie Margot drives past the Barbie White House which is, of
course, pink.

<b>INT. BARBIE OVAL OFFICE. LIGHT PINK HOUSE. DAY
</b>
Barbie Issa Rae, president (maybe in a ball gown?!) signs a
bill into law, surrounded by Barbie Congresswomen. Barbie
Margot stands with the press, proud.

<b>                    BARBIE ISSA
</b>          Everybody - turn to the Barbie next
          to you, tell her how much you love
          her. Compliment her!
<b>                    (MORE)
</b><b>                                                           5.
</b><b>                    BARBIE ISSA (CONT'D)
</b>          Reporter Barbie, you can ask me any
          question you want.

<b>                    BARBIE RITU
</b>          How come you're so amazing?

<b>                    BARBIE ISSA
</b>              (giggling)
          No comment! No seriously, no
          comment.

Barbie Issa looks to the Barbies around her:

<b>                    BARBIE ISSA
</b>          I love you guys!

Hugs, sweetness, support. It is REALLY great here.

<b>INT. NOBEL PRIZE THEATRE. DAY.
</b>
A big ceremony, very official, proper. A Barbie Dignitary (in
another flouncy ballgown) presides:

<b>                    BARBIE DIGNITARY
</b>          The Nobel Prize in Journalism goes
          to "BARBIE!"

It's Reporter Barbie! Woohoo! Barbie Margot leaps to her
feet, deeply proud.

<b>                    BARBIE RITU
</b>          I worked very hard, so... I deserve
          it!

<b>                    BARBIE DIGNITARY
</b>          The Nobel Prize in Literature goes
          to "BARBIE!"

It's Barbie Alexandra Shipp! Barbie Margot claps and hoots
from the audience. She's so proud of her friends.

<b>                    BARBIE ANNOUNCER
</b>              (bestowing the prize)
          You're the voice of a generation.

<b>                    BARBIE ALEXANDRA
</b>              (no false modesty!)
          I know.

<b>INT. SUPREME COURT. DAY
</b>
Barbie Sharon argues a case passionately in front of the
Supreme Court, all Barbies.
<b>                                                            6.
</b>

<b>                    BARBIE SHARON
</b>          Only Barbies are Barbies, and we
          would argue that corporations have
          no "free speech" rights to begin
          with, so any claim on their part to
          be exercising a right is just their
          attempt to turn our democracy into
          a plutocracy!

The Gallery erupts into rapturous applause. Some Kens are
there for support.

<b>                    BARBIE SHARON
</b>          This makes me emotional! And I'm
          expressing it. I have no difficulty
          holding both logic and feeling at
          the same time. It does not diminish
          my powers, it expands them.

The Chief Justice Barbie hits her gavel, but she can't help
but smile. Barbie Margot is there, always cheering on, always
the supporter.

<b>EXT. BARBIE LAND. DAY.
</b>
Barbie Margot drives past the BAX airport and an airplane
passes overhead, we move up, and the female pilot waves down -

<b>                       BARBIE PILOT
</b>          Hi Barbie!

- the airplane wipes and we keep moving up to find:

<b>EXT. SPACE. DAY
</b>
Astronaut Barbie floats around in space. High fives with
another Astronaut Barbie. Wave down to Barbie Margot, too!

<b>                     BARBIE ASTRONAUTS
</b>              (in unison)
          Hi Barbie!

<b>EXT./INT. BARBIE CAR.
</b>
Barbie Margot waves up at the astronauts.

<b>                       BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Yay space!

Finally she passes and salutes Barbie Mt. Rushmore.

Remember this!
<b>                                                           7.
</b>

<b>EXT. BARBIE LAND. BEACH. DAY
</b>
Barbie Margot drives up & hits the beach. This is semi-epic,
almost somber in it's initial grandeur.

Ken Ryan Gosling holds a surf board and stands atop of a
dune. He's waiting for his Barbie, Barbie Margot.

<b>                    HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)
</b>          Barbie has a great day every day.
          But Ken only has a great day if
          Barbie looks at him.

<b>                     KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>              (courageous)
          Hi Barbie!

Barbie Margot turns and smiles.

<b>                       BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Hi Ken!

All the Barbies we just saw are now at the beach - they are
all everything. Barbie Margot says Hi to Barbies and Ken -
or, rather, the Multiplicity of Kens!

<b>                    KEN SIMU
</b>              (to Ken Ryan Gosling)
          Hi Ken.

Ken Ryan Gosling groans, waving his hand in dismissal.

<b>                       BARBIE HARI
</b>          Hi Ken!

<b>                       KEN NCUTI

</b>          Hi Ken!

Everyone says "Hi Barbie" and "Hi Ken" over and over to each
other. Way out in the sea, a few Mermaid Barbies emerge:

<b>                    BARBIE MERMAID
</b>          Hi Barbies!

<b>                     ALL BARBIES AND KENS
</b>          Hi Barbie!
              (she disappears beneath
               the waves)
          Bye Barbie!

<b>                       ALLAN
</b>          Hi Barbie!

<b>                       BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Hi Allan!

And there's Allan in his striped shirt. Everything stops.

<b>                    HELLEN MIRREN (V.O.)
</b>          There are no multiples of Allan.
          He's just Allan.

<b>                    ALLAN
</b>          I'm still confused about that?

On shore, Ken Ryan Gosling comes sprinting down the sand.

<b>                       KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b><b>          HI BARBIE!

</b>          Hey Barbie! Check me out!

Ken Ryan Gosling, who seems to only exist when Barbie is
paying attention to him, runs into the surf, like INTO it,
and flies backward, head over heels, into the air with his
surfboard and...lands HARD.
<b>                                                            9.

</b>              (Hecuba at Troy)
<b>          KEN! NO!
</b>
Barbie Margot and her other Barbie friends jump up and
swiftly coordinate a rescue mission, while the other Kens
stand around helplessly. Ken Kingsley protects his ice
creams.

<b>                       BARBIE MARGOT
</b>                 (concerned)
          Ken?

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          Oh Hi Barbie... How much of that
          did you see?

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          We saw the whole thing!

<b>                    BARBIE ANA
</b>          Let's get you up on your feet.

Barbie Margot and Barbie Ana lift Ken up.

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          Wow you are so strong!

Meanwhile, Ken Simu laughs derisively:

<b>                    KEN SIMU
</b>          Looks like this beach was a little
          too much beach for you, Ken.

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          If I wasn't severely injured I'd
          beach you off right now, Ken.

<b>                    KEN SIMU
</b>          Oh, I'll beach-off with you any
          day, Ken!

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          You're on, Ken! Let's beach-off!

<b>                    KEN KINGSLEY
</b>              (on Ken Ryan's side)
          Anyone who wants to beach him off
          has to beach me off first.

<b>                     KEN SIMU
</b>          I will beach both of you off at the
          same time!

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING

          You don't even know how to beach
          your SELF off how are you going to
          beach all of us off??

<b>                    KEN SIMU
</b>          Why are you getting emotional?!

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Come on, Kens, nobody is going to
          beach anyone off!

Ken Simu backs off as Ken Ryan collapses into Barbie Margot.

An ambulance pulls up, and FOLDS OUT INTO A HOSPITAL ROOM.

Ken Ryan is put on a stretcher and hurried across the beach.

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          Barbie, stay with me!

<b>EXT. / INT. AMBULANCE / HOSPITAL. MOMENTS LATER.
</b>
Barbie Alexandra now in her "Doctor" outfit, tends to a small
scratch, while Barbie Hari, also in her "Doctor" outfit,
looks at the results of some x-rays. Barbie Margot stands by.

<b>                    BARBIE HARI
</b>          Not even broken, you'll be just
          fine.

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          Shredding waves is much more
          dangerous than people know.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          You're very brave, Ken.

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          Thanks, Barbie. Because you know
          actually my job isn't surfer.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          I know.

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          It's not even lifeguard, which is a
          common misconception.

<b>       BARBIE ALEXANDRA               KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>Very common.                   Because my job is actually
                               just, you know, Beach.
<b>                                                          11.

<b>                    BARBIE HARI
</b>          And what a good job you do at
          Beach.

<b>                    BARBIE ALEXANDRA
</b>          You should heal up in no time.
          Actually by the time I finished
          that sentence, you healed.

<b>                       KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          Fantastic!

He leaps off the table and does an "action man" pose. Then:

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          Hey, Barbie - Can I come over
          later?

Barbie Margot and Barbie Alexandra share a look.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Yeah, OK. I don't have anything big
          planned, just a giant blow-out
          party with all the Barbies, with
          planned choreography and a bespoke
          song. But you can stop by, sure.

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>              (with obvious admiration)
          Cool.

<b>EXT. / INT. BARBIE MARGOT'S DREAMHOUSE & STREET. NIGHT.
</b>
Barbie Margot has a big block party with all her Barbie
friends, plus Allan and Midge (whom we stay away from!)

DJ BARBIE turns up a   song (which is the AMAZING ORIGINAL HIT
SONG FOR THIS MOVIE)   and there is a GIANT gorgeous musical
number, starring the   Barbies! With Kens as dancing
decoration! It's fun   and sweeping and funny and a real toe-
tapper all around.

Ken Simu joins Barbie Margot for part of the dance, stoking
Ken Ryan Gosling's ire, who is held back, in a dancing way,
by Ken Kingsley.

Ken Ryan Gosling jumps up and tries to breakdance badly. Ken
Kingsley joins in for moral support..

<b>                    KEN SIMU
</b>          Hey Barbie! Check me out!

Ken Simu does a flip on the dance floor. Ken Ryan Gosling is
enraged.
<b>                                                          12.
</b>

Barbie Margot turns and dances with her friends whom she'd
much rather be dancing with anyway. This leaves the Kens all
dancing together, which is just obviously funny.

Shouting over the music and dancing, Barbie Margot and
friends appreciate how terrific everything is:

<b>                    BARBIE ALEXANDRA
</b>              (while dancing)
          This is a real rager, Barbie!

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>              (also dancing)
          THANKS BARBIE! Gosh this night is
          just perfect!

<b>                    BARBIE SHARON
</b>          It's perfectly perfect!

<b>                    BARBIE EMMA
</b>          You look so beautiful Barbie!

<b>                     BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Thank you Barbie! I FEEL so
          beautiful!

<b>                     BARBIE SHARON
</b>          So do I!

<b>                    BARBIE HARI
</b>          This is the best day ever!

Dancing and shouting and so happy it almost hurts:

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          It IS the best day ever! And so is
          yesterday and so is tomorrow and so
          is the day after tomorrow and even
          Wednesdays and every day from now
          until FOREVER!

Suddenly, as the flip side of the coin of this thought:

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>              (still shouting)
          Do you ever think about dying?!

Literal record scratch and everything is quiet. All the
Barbies and Kens look at her. She's broken the movie.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>              (to herself)
          I don't know why I just said that?
<b>                    (MORE)
</b><b>                                                         13.
</b><b>                    BARBIE MARGOT (CONT'D)
</b>              (to everyone else)
          I'm just dying to DANCE!

There is panic in Barbie Margot's eyes as she starts
maniacally dancing, doing about eight different dance moves
from over the decades, starting with the Twist, going through
disco, punk, break dancing, etc.

The music picks back up, and she is relieved, although
troubled by what just happened. She shakes it off, and
continues to party. Maybe there is nothing wrong!

<b>LATER THAT EVENING...
</b>
After their fun party, Barbie Margot and Ken Ryan Gosling
stand in the moonlight. Ken leans forward for a goodnight
kiss. He gets part of the way there and then pulls back.

<b>                       KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>                 (re: the "kiss")
          Wow.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>              (smiling sweetly)
          You can go now.

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          I was thinking that maybe I could,
          you know, stay over tonight?

<b>                       BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Why?

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          `Cause we're girlfriend boyfriend.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          To do what?

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          To... I'm not actually sure...

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          But I don't want you here.

She's smiling her gorgeous smile. Not mean, just truthful.

<b>                       KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>                 (bummed)
          Ok.
              (pause)
          Is it Ken?
<b>                                                        14.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          No, Ken is just a good friend.
              (as if it's comforting:)
          And after all, this is MY
          Dreamhouse. It's Barbie's
          Dreamhouse. Not Ken's Dreamhouse.
          Right?

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>              (chastened)
          Right as always.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          And: It's girl's night!

We cut to the other side of them to reveal that all of Barbie
Margot's friends are there, watching it all unfold.

<b>                    BARBIE EMMA (O.S.)
</b>          Come on, Barbie, slumber party!

<b>                    BARBIE HARI
</b>          Come on! The president is here!

<b>                    BARBIE ISSA
</b>          I am. You're welcome!

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING

          Every night.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Forever and ever! Goodnight!

She runs back to her friends. They scream and are THRILLED.
Phew, Ken was a LOT!

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>              (acting out the fantasy)
          I love you too. But I can't... I
          gotta go.

And then he leaves, thank goodness. She likes Ken, but she
needs her space!

<b>INT. BARBIE DREAMHOUSE, BEDROOM. NIGHT. LATER.
</b>
Barbie Margot tucks herself into bed:
<b>                                                          15.

<b>                      BARBIE MARGOT
</b>                (to her Barbie neighbors)
            Goodnight Barbies! I'm definitely
            not thinking about death any more!

Her eyes fly open - she IS THOUGH.

<b>INT. BARBIE DREAMHOUSE, BEDROOM. MORNING.
</b>
MORNING! Barbie opens her eyes, ready for an amazing day. But
something is off, she can feel it - she feels groggy, her
eyes don't want to open. She stretches, stiff from sleeping.

She makes a face, cups her hands and smells her breath. YUCK!

<b>INT. BARBIE DREAMHOUSE, BATHROOM. DAY
</b>
She brushes her teeth with nothing, but the gesture makes a
difference.

Same shower situation, but suddenly Barbie YELPS and leaps
out of the way of the non-water.

<b>                         BARBIE
</b>            What the--

How was the water that isn't even there COLD?! She adjusts
the knobs and then steps back under the non-water. Better.

<b>KITCHEN
</b>
Same breakfast situation, but the plastic waffle is burnt -
how is that even possible? She pours milk into a glass (which
is nothing) and drinks. Spits it out. Looks at the container.

<b>                         BARBIE
</b>            Expired?!

Barbie   Margot turns and sees (because remember there are no
walls)   another Barbie at her breakfast table, who smiles and
waves.   Barbie Margot tries to muscle through it - she's going
to try   to smile her way out of this, darn it!

But what is this new feeling? Is it... shame?

<b>EXT. BARBIE DREAMHOUSE. DAY
</b>
Barbie Margot stands at the edge of the roof, waiting to be
flown into her car, and she leans into the air and...

FALLS. Just belly flops into the air.

She pops up out from behind her car, trying to save face,
waving.
<b>                                                        16.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>              (to nobody)
          I'm fine! A-ok!

People look at her curiously. What is wrong with her?

<b>EXT. BARBIE LAND. BEACH. DAY
</b>
Barbie Margot and Co. all hang out together on the beach.
It's pretty fun, but not perfect fun.

The Barbies play a wicked game of Beach Volleyball while the
Kens cheer (like reverse Top Gun, remember this).

<b>                    ALLAN
</b>          Great cheer, Kens!

Everyone else laughs earnestly but when Barbie Margot tries,
it's forced.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>              (tripping over the laugh)
          Ha, ha. Ha ha ha ha ha.Ha.

Something is wrong. Why can't she really laugh?

<b>                     BARBIE ANA
</b>              (calling out)
          Come on, Barbie, let's run towards
          the water!

Barbie Margot steps up on her tip-toes and wobbles weirdly on
the sand. She can't hold it any longer, her foot cramps and
she topples to the ground. She looks down and discovers that
her feet are - SHOCK! HORROR! - No longer arched!!!

She's just got big ole flat feet. She gasps and tries to
crawl herself to the beach bench. Barbie Alexandra, Barbie
Hari, Barbie Sharon, Barbie Emma and Barbie Ana rush over:

<b>                    BARBIE SHARON
</b>          Hey Barbie, are you OK?

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT

Barbie Hari throws up nothing. Same with Barbie Alexandra.
Ken Kingsley joins in, throwing up nothing.

          I know I'm Stereotypical Barbie,
          and therefore don't form
          conjectures concerning the
          causality of adjacent unfolding
          events, but some stuff has been
          happening that might be related:
          bad breath this morning, a cold
          shower, burnt waffle, falling off
          my roof...

Barbie Alexandra gasps, hand over mouth.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          But I've never had to go visit
          Weird Barbie.

<b>                    BARBIE HARI
</b>          That's because you've never
          malfunctioned.

<b>                    BARBIE SHARON
</b>          I heard that she used to be the
          most beautiful Barbie of all but
          then someone played too hard with
          her in the Real World...

CUT TO: The REAL WORLD with a little girl doing that thing we
all do to our Barbies at some point. She snips off her hair,
colors her face with marker, lights her hair on fire, puts
her in the splits and drop kicks her into her toy bin.

BACK TO: Barbie Margot looking concerned. Barbie Hari is in a
trance of the Legend of Weird Barbie:

<b>                    BARBIE HARI
</b>          ...and now she's fated to an
          eternity of making other Barbies
          perfect while falling more and more
          into disrepair herself. And that we
          call her Weird Barbie all the time
          both behind her back and also to
          her face.
              (happy again)
          Anyway, you have to go see her!

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Ugh, she's SO Weird. And why is she
          always in the splits?

<b>EXT/INT. WEIRD BARBIE'S WEIRDHOUSE. DAY
</b>
Barbie Margot climbs the seemingly never-ending stairs up to
the Weirdhouse. It's like an abstract art version of every
girl's Dreamhouse after she's played with it for years. Think
Jeff Koons, Gaudi, Murakami all put in a blender.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          I would never wear heels if my feet
          were shaped this way!

Barbie Margot steps gingerly in, looking around.
<b>                                                           19.

<b>                       BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Um, hello?

Barbie Margot frowns. A dog (Tanner) passes by and poops out
little plastic pellets. Barbie Margot steps around them.

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE (O.S.)
</b>              (from the dark)
          What's cookin' good lookin'?

A pool of light illuminates Weird Barbie - she's in the
splits, has an unintentionally asymmetrical short haircut and
mismatched clothes. She's like David Bowie + a hairless cat.

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          Welcome, welcome to my Weirdhouse.

Weird Barbie hitches her leg down and lopes oddly into a
giant room. Maybe she does a flip or two.

<b>                     WEIRD BARBIE
</b>              (looking at the floor)
          Sorry about the dog crap! Why
          anyone would want to introduce
          pooping into a doll universe is
          beyond me.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT

          I had to come see you about -- My

</b>          Yeah. Can you fix them?

<b>                     WEIRD BARBIE
</b>               (suspicious)
          You're Stereotypical Barbie, aren't
          you?
<b>                                                          20.

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          I'd love to see what kind of nude
          blob he's packing under those
          jeans.

She claps her open hands together like the way little kids
mash Barbies together. Barbie Margot watches with horror. It
goes on too long and then stops as suddenly as it started:

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          Anyway. What preceded this?

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Oh, um, nothing. A really fun game
          of volleyball...

<b>                      WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          Really?!

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>              (mumbles)
          Thoughts of death.

Weird Barbie looks at her horrified. Small voice:

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Is that a problem?

<b>                      WEIRD BARBIE

          Oh.

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          I'd heard this was possible but
          I've never seen it happen before.

<b>                      BARBIE MARGOT

<b>                                                        21.

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          You've opened a portal!

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          I didn't open a portal!

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          Well, someone did! There is a rip
          in the continuum that is the
          membrane between Barbie Land and
          the Real World and if you want to
          be Stereotypical Barbie perfect
          again you've got to go fix it! Or
          you're going to keep going funny.
          Look at your upper thigh.

She does. Ack! A dimple.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          What is that?!

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          CELLULITE. It'll spread EVERYWHERE
          and you'll start getting mushy and
          sad and... complicated.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          NO!!! What do I have to do?!?

With that, Weird Barbie turns and travels through her house,
up and over all of the strange architecture. Barbie Margot
tries to keep up.

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          You have to go to the Real World
          and find the girl who is playing
          with you.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Playing with me?

Weird Barbie goes through the mess around her, finding a
technical drawing which she refers to briefly and then gets
tired and throws it back on the stack.

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          We're all being played with!
          Usually there's some kind of
          separation: there's the Girl, aka
          the Player, and the Doll, aka the
          Playee. And never the twain shall
          cross.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          The twain is crossing?

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>              (another drawing)
          Yes! The girl playing with you must
          be sad and her thoughts and
          feelings and humanness are
          interfering with your dollness. Am
          I being too technical?

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Why would she be sad? We fixed
          everything so that all women in the
          real world are happy and powerful!

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b><b>          I DON'T KNOW!
</b>              (looking at her hard)
          If you ask me, you're responsible
          for this, too. It usually takes two
          to rip the portal.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          ME?! But I didn't do anything. I've
          only ever wanted for things to be
          exactly as they are.

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          Well however it happened, you and
          she are becoming inextricably
          intertwined. You have to help her
          to help yourself.

Weird Barbie holds her hands out: this is a Matrix moment
where Barbie Margot is offered two different versions of
life, i.e. red pill and blue pill, except for Weird Barbie
holds a high-heeled shoe in one hand and a Birkenstock sandal
in the other. Very dramatic, full of meaning and moodiness.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>              (re: Birkenstock)
          What is that?!

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>              (cryptically)
          So what will it be? You can go back
          to the way your life was--
              (holding the high heel up)
          --and not even remember that this
          happened, or you can know the truth
          about the universe.
              (holds up the Birkenstock
               and with a woo-woo voice)

</b>          The question is planted in your
          mind. The choice is yours.

Breaking the "mysterious" spell, Barbie Margot answers
instantly and with too much chipper energy:

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          The first one. The high heel.

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>              (annoyed)
          No. We'll do a redo. You're
          supposed to want to know!

          I don't.

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          Babe, listen. You have to want to
          know.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          I'm not Adventure Barbie, I'm
          Stereotypical Barbie. I'm like the
          Barbie you think of when someone
          says "think of a Barbie" and that's
          me!

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          That is so sad.

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          You're doing this anyway.
          I just gave you a choice so you
          could feel like you're in control!

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          NO! You have to go fix the rip
          yourself. Don't blame me, blame
          Mattel, they make the rules.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Ugh, I don't want to go.

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          Fine, get cellulite, I don't care.

Weird Barbie turns away. On Barbie Margot. She summons all
her bravery. She wants to meet the moment.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>              (steels herself)
          Send me through the portal.

Weird Barbie laughs, and then opens a toy-manual.

<b>                     WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          Oh, no, there's no portal to the
          other world. That's just a figure
          of speech.

We see the different vehicles as she rattles off:

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          It's a sports car to a speed boat
          to a rocket ship to a tandem bike
          to a camper van--FUN--to a
          snowmobile--BRR--which will take
          you most of the way to the state of
          Los Angeles where you'll don neon
          and rollerblades and enter the
          country of California. Weird, I
          know. Best if you don't think about
          it too much.

Weird Barbie takes a swig from a flask with nothing in it (of
course), presentation done. After all the energy she now
seems tired of this whole business, and hurries Barbie Margot
out.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          When I'm there, how do I find this
          girl?

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT

Barbie Margot screams.

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          And then you will look like me.

Barbie Margot screams again.

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE

Barbie gathers around her car with her friends.

Back to the Kens. The other group of Kens are playing a very
mysterious game which appears to be mostly guessing:

Barbie Margot hops in her convertible, waving and driving off
into the sunset.

<b>INT. CONVERTIBLE/EXT. BARBIE LAND OPEN ROAD. MORNING
</b>
Barbie Margot drives and sings along SUPER LOUD to Indigo
Girls "Closer to Fine," which for some reason they have in
Barbie Land. She's loving this adventure, actually!

Ken Ryan Gosling pops up in the backseat singing and Barbie
Margot screams her head off and he screams at her screaming.
They skid off the road, flipping over a few times and then
landing upright in the desert.

He accepts this, and they're OFF! Dramatic music as they go
through all the different kinds of transportation.

<b>                    HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)
</b>          So Barbie and Ken set off on their
          adventure to the Real World!

<b>EXT. TRANSPORTATION
</b>
Sports Car - back in their car and on the ROAD! Into...

Speed Boat - Barbie drives the speedboat while Ken hides from
a seagull.

Rocket Ship - Barbie and Ken wear space suits and ride a
rocket, which makes zero sense.

Tandem Bike - through the prairie OR the French Alps? Barbie
on the front of the bike, Ken behind.

Camper Van - In a National Park they screech to a stop, jump
off their bikes, and set up a little grill. Ken flips a
burger while Barbie chills out in a lawn chair, reading a
tabloid.

Snowmobile - BACK TO THE ACTION! - Ken hangs on to Barbie for
dear life as she catches air over slaloms.

<b>EXT. VENICE BOARDWALK
</b>
Rollerblades - Finally they are in the sunny state of
California, in the town of LA, on the boardwalk of Venice
Beach - wearing rollerblades.

Barbie Margot wears a bikini and Ken wears a onesie. They're
openly getting a lot of looks. Just the two of them in REAL
Los Angeles is genuinely strange and hilarious. They appear
as extremely good-looking aliens.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Wow! The Real World!

Ken smiles and waves loving all of this, but Barbie Margot
looks confused bordering on anxious.

Note: this is more real than Barbie Land but still
heightened, like a 1980s comedy - slightly exaggerated. Like
there is no way Ferris Bueller sang the Beatles at that
German parade, but we allow it because it's fun. Same here.

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          See, I told you there'd be Beach!
<b>                                                           30.

</b>              (hollering at her)
          Give us a smile, blondie.

People are laughing and pointing and amused and also leering.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          What's going on, why are all these

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          They're also looking at ME!

Up ahead is a construction site, workers on break for lunch.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Oh, great! A construction site! We
          need that good feminine energy.

But as they get closer, it's not what she thought.
Construction workers eat sandwiches and cat-call Barbie.

          --doesn't have a penis. We don't
          have genitals

The Construction Workers look at them blankly and then shrug,
unbothered. This is Los Angeles after all, live and let live!

<b>                    CONSTRUCTION WORKERS
</b>          Far out!... That's okay... Whatever
          works... you do you...

Gosling tries to impress the construction workers.

He catches up to Barbie Margot.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Jeez, you would think a
          construction site at lunchtime
          would be the perfect place for a
          little woman-power. But this one
          was so... male.

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>              (a little excited)
          Yeah everything is almost, like,
          reversed, here.

There's a slight moment here. Like maybe he's ON to
something... But they're distracted as they pass a large
billboard advertising The Miss Universe Contest:

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING

Another Beach dude passes by and slaps Barbie Margot on the
ass. Barbie Margot punches him in the face. Ken screams.

Then they are being finger printed. Over and over again
because the cops can't find any prints. The cops drool over
Barbie Margot:

Ken Ryan Gosling exits wearing all denim with fringe and a
cowboy hat, followed by Barbie Margot, who wears a pink
cowgirl outfit. ALL the security lights and bells go, but

kid, unable to sit still.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT

He makes faces, then goes for a walk.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>              (eyes still closed)
          Don't go far!

<b>EXT. CENTURY CITY. DAY.
</b>
Ken Ryan Gosling walks under a sign for: CENTURY CITY. He
looks up: A tall building looms over him and he starts
putting together the world a little bit. He sees:

- A gym, full of men.

- A man in a mink.

- A policeman on a horse.
<b>                                                          34.

- A Hummer, stuffed to the brim with businessmen.

- Generic men in business suits shaking hands having generic
business conversations.

<b>                    BUSINESSMEN
</b>          Great deal. Great deal. We're all
          going to make a lot of money.

A female secretary tries to come up and tell her boss
something, he holds up his hand to stop her:

<b>                    BUSINESSMEN
</b>          In a second, Margaret.
              (to his associates)
          Shall we all shake on it?

She backs away, submissive, as they all shake madly. Ken Ryan
cannot believe what he's seeing. Are they more powerful than
she is?? How is this possible?

Ken Ryan Gosling rides an escalator up to a giant video
screen, playing images of Big Man Stuff:

- Money, Presidents, Golf videos, mini-fridges, a bunch of
dudes working out at the gym. Men in sports, men as statues,
men in paintings, important men in photographs, the Greased
Lightening scene from Grease, all culminating in Sylvester
Stallone in a mink coat.

- MEN EVERYWHERE and then just another horse and then MORE
<b>MEN EVERYWHERE!
</b>
<b>EXT. POLICE STATION. DAY
</b>
Barbie Margot still sitting on the bench, breathes in and
out, and sees:

Glimpses of A Girl, maybe a pigtail, some chipped nail
polish. She's "Shining" or something like that. But without
the horror!

- The Girl laughing with her Mom, eating ice cream.

- The Girl opening the door saying "Mom, I had a bad dream."

- The Girl playing Barbies with her Mom - her Mom shows her a
Barbie idea sketch and the girl applauds.

- The Girl is getting older, moving away when her Mom tries
to show affection.

- The Girl plops a box of her Barbies and Barbie accessories
in front of her Mom, clearly marked "Goodwill."
<b>                                                        35.

- The Mom sadly drops her daughter off at school, and when
she tries to wave at her, the Girl pretends not to see her.
It's junior high. Everyone is their worst self in junior
high.

CLOSE on Barbie Margot, a tear rolls down her face.

Barbie opens her eyes. She wipes the tear from her face. She
looks down at the moisture in her hand. She's never cried
before.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>              (to herself)
          That felt achy... but good.

Barbie Margot looks around - across the street she sees a
park, filled with mundane and beautiful and funny and sad
moments of every day life.

- A young couple with a baby.

- Kids playing tag.

- A teen girl crying and being comforted by another girl.

- Best friends laughing together.

- A middle aged couple walking hand in hand.

- Three friends in an argument.

- An old man feeds the birds.

- Someone reading a book.

- A man with a child.

- Guys kicking a ball around.

- 20-somethings arguing.

- A young man who looks like he's been crying.

Next to her an Older Woman sits on a bench, reading. Barbie
studies her for a moment.

Barbies don't get old, so this is something she doesn't have
experience with. The woman, as if she can feel Barbie's gaze
on her, looks up. They meet eyes. The Older Woman nods in
greeting.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          You're so beautiful.

Ken runs up to her, breaking the moment.

She turns to him, and he and Barbie excitedly say:

<b>       KEN RYAN GOSLING                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>I've got it!                       I've got it!

</b>          No you!

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT

</b>          The girl is at school!

<b>        BARBIE MARGOT                     KEN RYAN GOSLING

                                   let's go to the SCHOOL!

They both run off together, and Barbie sneaks a glance back,
but the old woman is back to reading her newspaper, the
moment has passed.

Another younger employee peers over the top of his cubicle:

</b>          What?!

<b>                    AARON DINKINS

</b>          What?! When?!

<b>                    AARON DINKINS
</b>          About ten years ago a woman named
          Skipper turned up in Key West at
          some family's home and asked to
          babysit the kids... She then tried
          to take their toddler surfing. We
          were able to straighten it out and
          keep it under wraps.
              (grave)
          But this is serious.

<b>                    AARON DINKINS
</b>          I'm going all the way up.

<b>INT. MATTEL HEADQUARTERS. ELEVATOR.

He takes a deep breath and steps into the elevator. Floors
tick by 99, 100, 101. Walks briskly down a huge hallway.

<b>INT. MATTEL HEADQUARTERS. BOARDROOM RECEPTION.
</b>
CLOSE on some sketches of Barbie. But these Barbies look
distressed, mascara running down her cheeks from crying. She
wears the identical clothes to Barbie Margot.

A woman, Gloria, sits at a reception desk. She's in her late
30s, but has something of the kid in her, a pair of pink
shoes? We love her! She is drawing the sketch.

Gloria has an old Barbie on her desk which resembles Barbie
Margot. And next to that a photo of her daughter. She's
singing "Closer to Fine" to herself.

Aaron stops at the desk. Gloria is so lost in her drawing she
doesn't see him. He clears his throat.

<b>                    AARON DINKINS
</b>          Um... Gloria.

He snaps his fingers. She shakes her head and looks at him.

</b>          Oh, hi, Aaron.

<b>                    AARON DINKINS

<b>                    GLORIA
</b>          Yeah, for some reason I just
          started drawing her. I don't know
          why.

She hands them to him.

<b>                    RECEPTIONIST/GLORIA
</b>          They're in a big corporate ideas

          AARON stop it!...

<b>INT. MATTEL HEADQUARTERS. BOARDROOM
</b>
He opens a door to a giant PINK GLITTERY board room. It's
like the inside of a 5 year old girl's sparkly heart.

He doesn't wait for an answer, already so pumped to say:

</b>          Female agency.

<b>                    AARON DINKINS
</b>          Um... excuse me...

A table of men turns around all at once. They're all wearing
suits but it somehow feels like tuxedos.

<b>                    MATTEL CEO
</b>          Who are you?

<b>                    AARON DINKINS
</b>          Aaron Dinkins, sir.

<b>                    AARON DINKINS
</b>          But, I think you're going to want
          to hear this, sir.

<b>                    MATTEL CEO
</b>          Can you just email it? And you can
          send it to me EOD

          End of day.

<b>                    AARON DINKINS
</b>          May I put it in a whisper, sir?

<b>                    MATTEL CEO
</b>          Ugh, fine, whisper me.

Aaron Dinkins leans in and whispers something to the Mattel
Executive #1. He's ashen. He turns and whispers to the man
next to him and each man in turn reacts and whispers to the
man next to him. Finally, the CEO listens with shock:

<b>                    MATTEL CEO
</b>          My god it's a repeat of Skipper in
          Key West.

<b>                    AARON DINKINS
</b>          And with all due respect, that was
          Skipper, sir. This is...
              (dramatically)
          Barbie.

They all react. The Mattel CEO stands up, dramatically.
<b>                                                        41.

<b>                    MATTEL CEO
</b>          If this got out, that our dolls
          were coming to Los Angeles from
          Barbie Land as life-size versions
          of themselves and roaming the earth
          it would be very bad...
              (lame finish)
          ... for business.

CUT TO: Gloria listens outside the conference room doors. She
shakes her head, doing some insane calculation.

          No, that's impossible.

          Right?

We CUT BACK inside the BOARD ROOM:

<b>                     MATTEL EXECUTIVE #2

          How much do you weigh? Never mind.
          This sounds like a job for the box.

<b>EXT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL. AFTERNOON

Barbie Margot and Ken Ryan Gosling approach the school.
Barbie Margot sticks out even more here, as the kids are all
wearing dark colors trying not to be noticed. You know,
Junior High School.

</b>          I feel amazing.

<b>                    MOM

Gosling try to not look sketchy.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          She's got to be here somewhere.

They pass the library and Ken says, kind of suspiciously:

<b>EXT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL. CAFETERIA

Barbie scans all the different girls' faces and then BAM -
like Roy Scheider in "JAWS" seeing that kid getting eaten -
she sees her Girl, the one from her vision!

Her Girl is sitting in a VERY prominent table with a group of
other pretty 13 year old girls. She's clearly popular. They
all have Hydroflasks, big t-shirts, scrunchies, Mario Badescu
Or whatever kids are into after this pandemic!

She begins to walk towards the girl but is interrupted by:

<b>                    OTHER GIRL
</b>          What are you doing?

Indicating the one she thinks is HER girl:

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          What's that girl's name?

<b>                    OTHER GIRL

          That's Sasha.

<b>                    OTHER GIRL
</b>              (panicking)
          NO DON'T TALK TO HER! Sasha can
          talk to you but you can never talk
          to Sasha. She'll crush you.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Don't worry - everyone likes me and
          thinks I'm cool and pretty.

<b>                       OTHER GIRL

<b>                       BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Thank you!

And then she goes up to talk to Sasha, and all these 13-year-
old queen bees turn to look at her. NOTE: this is the
opposite of what Barbie (and we!) think will happen.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT

Sasha and her friends stare at Barbie Margot, stunned:

</b>          No way! Barbie's not a bimbo!

<b>                    SASHA
</b>          Ok, Barbie, let's do this.

Sasha's verbal jabs are like a boxer relentlessly landing
punches in a ring, maybe we even shoot it like Raging Bull.
She is clearly so smart and so articulate that you can't help
but admire her.

<b>                    SASHA

<b>                    SASHA
</b>          You represent everything wrong with
          our culture: sexualized capitalism,
          unrealistic physical ideals.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Whoa hang on you're describing
          something stereotypical. Barbie is
          so much more than that.

<b>                    SASHA
</b>          Look at yourself!

</b>              (she has a point)
          Well, I am, actually, Stereotypical
          Barbie.

<b>                    SASHA
</b>          You set the feminist movement back
          fifty years, you destroy girls'
          innate sense of worth and you're
          killing the planet with your
          glorification of rampant
          consumerism.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          But, but I'm supposed to help you
          and make you happy and powerful -

<b>                    SASHA
</b>          - I am powerful and until you
          showed up here and declared
          yourself "Barbie", I hadn't thought
          about you in years, you FASCIST.

Barbie bursts into tears and runs away. The Other Girl
watches Barbie run, and just shakes her head.

<b>                    THE OTHER GIRL
</b>          They never listen.

We stay with Sasha for a moment, who suddenly feels bad.
Under all the bravado is a lot of feeling.

books in his arms -   Men & Wars, The Origins of the
Patriarchy, Why Men   Rule (Literally) and just one called
Horses. His mind is   blown.

A Female Pedestrian stops and asks, casually:

Ken feels like he was just declared king.

</b>          Why didn't Barbie tell me about

not thrilled to see him again.

she recognizes her. But although Gloria can see Barbie
Margot, Barbie Margot can't see Gloria.

... as one of the Mattel employees shuts the doors on
Barbie's friendly face, and looks around all secret-agent-

             with this, and I have to say I
             really resent it because we are a
             company literally MADE of women.
             There was a woman CEO in the 90's
             and another one at some other time.
             Women are the freaking foundation
             of this long phallic building! We
             have gender neutral bathrooms up
             the wazoo! Every single one of
             these men you see before you loves
             women.

Everyone gasps!

<b>                    MATTEL CEO
</b>          What?! I can't say JEZEBEL now?!

Barbie Margot seems unfazed, looks at the box.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          I haven't been in a box in ages.

One executive steps into the box and then jumps back out.

<b>                    MATTEL CEO
</b>          See it's easy.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b><b>          OK.
</b>
She slowly steps into the box.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          I totally remember this smell! I'm
          having a real Proustian flashback.

          Remember Proust Barbie? That did
          not sell well.

The employees surround the box somewhat menacingly. A Mattel
Employee grabs the plastic ties from the holes in the back of
the box and pulls.

Barbie Margot feels the restraints tighten on her wrist. She
hesitates, it sinking in. She pulls her wrist out quickly
just as the plastic cinches. Then she jumps out of the box.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          You know what? Before I get in the

          beautiful.

<b>                    MATTEL CEO
</b>          OK, but let's hurry it up.

She backs over toward the bathroom and then zigs toward the
double doors of the conference room. Then she BOLTS!

<b>                    MATTEL CEO
</b>          Get that Barbie!

<b>INT. MATTEL CUBICLES. CONTINUOUS.
</b>
A BIG CHASE through the main bullpen offices of Mattel. The
CEO and all the executives hurry after her. It's like a giant
maze. Barbie Margot darts around the cubicles as employees
work, people pass from cubicle to cubicle popping up and
looking around, trying to spot her.

<b>                    MATTEL CEO
</b>              (to the troops)
          It's quicker if you go OVER the
          cubicles!

The CEO tries to scramble/climb badly over the TOP of a
cubicle and topples into an employee and a computer console.

Barbie sprints toward giant double doors on the other side of
the room. The Mattel Executives in hot pursuit. She hurries
through the doors and shoves a broom through the handles to
hold them off.

Barbie enters a big hallway with lots of doors, she tries
every one, but they're all locked. Trapped! Panicked! She
hears the executives getting closer. Then one door opens...

<b>INT. MAGICAL ROOM FROM THE 1950S. ETERNITY
</b>
She enters the room and shuts the door behind her.

<b>                    A VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          Oh, hello, come in.

Barbie Margot sees a woman, dressed like a mom in the 1950's.
The room we see resembles a 1950's kitchen. She's working on
something - her sewing machine is out, and there are scraps
of paper and cloth all over the kitchen table.
<b>                                                          57.

<b>                      1950 WOMAN

<b>                      BARBIE MARGOT
</b>                (looking around)
            What is this place?

<b>                      1950 WOMAN
</b>                (laughing at herself)
            I always find that I think best at
            kitchen tables. Tea?

<b>                      BARBIE MARGOT
</b>            Yes, please.

The   woman hands her the cup, which Barbie Margot brings to
her   lips then hesitates. A little dribbles down her chin but
she   is able to drink it too. She smiles, proud of herself.
She   feels strangely comfortable here.

<b>                      BARBIE MARGOT
</b>            So, a woman does work here.

<b>                      1950 WOMAN
</b>            Oh, sweetie, we do more than work
            here.

<b>                      BARBIE MARGOT
</b>                (comfortable)
            The real world isn't what I thought
            it was.

<b>                       1950 WOMAN
</b>                (smiling)
            It never is. And isn't that
            marvelous?

There is a moment that passes between them. Barbie Margot
feels the woman's gaze.

<b>                      BARBIE MARGOT
</b>            What? Is it that I don't know how
            to drink tea?

<b>                      1950 WOMAN
</b>            No. You look different.

<b>                      BARBIE MARGOT
</b>                (embarrassed)
            I'm not what I used to be. I used
            to be perfect.

</b>          I don't know, I think you're just
          right.

She settles down at her sewing machine and resumes her work.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Who... who are you?

We hear the Executives in the hallway, yelling, trying
doorknobs. Barbie Margot tenses. Without looking up, the
older woman indicates a closet next to the refrigerator.

<b>                    1950 WOMAN
</b>          If you go through that closet,
          you'll find a stairwell down to the
          lobby. Just be careful of the mops
          and brooms.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Thank you... ?

<b>                    1950 WOMAN
</b>              (smiling)
          Ruth.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Thank you, Ruth.

<b>                    RUTH
</b>          You're welcome, Barbie.

Barbie Margot hesitates then enters the cupboard. She pushes
through the mops and brooms. The cupboard extends beyond and
Barbie Margot finds herself in a narrow back stairwell.

<b>INT. LOBBY/EXT. STREET
</b>
Barbie Margot scampers across the lobby and onto the busy
street. She looks around desperately. She glances back
through the glass windows. Mattel Executives sliding across
the shiny, slippery lobby floor.

Barbie freezes, panicked. Gloria's car pulls up, door
opening.

<b>                    GLORIA
</b>          Get in!

Barbie Margot then SEES Gloria. Time slows down. It's the
"love look" completed. They see each other seeing each other.

Just then the Mattel Executives come running out of the
building.

and the car screeches off.

Town cars and vans pull up. The executives scramble inside.

CUT BACK to earlier images of mother and daughter, but this

away as she grows up.

She finally takes in the full transformation - There are mini-

basketball hoops & arcade games, chin-up bars in the
doorways, foosball, pool, ping pong, air hockey, it's all Ken
all the time, empowered through some strange game of
telephone with the real world...

Some of them have beards, some mustaches, a couple have
goatees. Every Ken is there, including Ken Simu. This embrace
of a Real World cartoon masculinity seems to have united
them. A now bearded Ken Ryan Gosling sporting a mink coat is
in the middle of a monologue. All the Kens listen, rapt.

The Kens turn to see Barbie Margot, Gloria and Sasha. Ken
Ryan Gosling is secretly thrilled she showed up. He'd been
wanting her to see what he was capable of. He tries to cover
with nonchalance.

He's hurt, but instead of admitting it, now he's going to go
full-out aggressive and posturing.

</b>          Buckle up, babe, because Barbie
          Land is now Ken Land and it'll be
          just like Century City in Los
          Angeles. Because they have it
          figured out in Century City.
              (describing a delicacy)
          The minute you get out of your car,
          you're like I can't believe how
          great this place is.

Ken Simu nods vigorously. He LOVES it!

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          No! They don't. They don't have it
          figured out in Century City.
          Because we failed them.

With sudden, personal intensity, almost crying, based on a
life-time of feeling like a second class citizen:

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          No, you failed me! Out there I was
          a SOMEBODY! I walked down the
          street and people respected me just
          for WHO I AM.
              (to the Kens)
          One lady even asked me for the
          time.

<b>                    KEN SIMU
</b><b>          NO WAY!
</b>
<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          WAY! Except for these dumb
          technicalities like MBAs and
          medical degrees and, I don't know,
          swim lessons, I could have ruled
          THAT world.

He attempts to slide down the hood of the Hummer but his mink
sticks to the metal and he moves at a glacial pace. Finally
landing on the ground:

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          But here I don't need any of those
          things. Here I'm just a DUDE! AND
<b>          THAT IS ENOUGH!
</b>
He raises a remote with a sense of triumph and switches the
channel on giant gross TV that has, until this point, been
playing romantic horse footage.

Ken Ryan Gosling turns triumphantly to Barbie Margot, but
also kind of wanting her approval.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          You can't do this. This is Barbie

Barbie Margot looks devastated.

A catch in his throat, this almost hurts him to say:

</b>          Every night is boy's night.

Ken Ryan Gosling feels for her, but then puts on sunglasses
to hide his emotion. Then he puts sunglasses on top of his
sunglasses and walks away. Cold as ice.

<b>EXT. CUL-DE-SAC. DAY

Barbie Margot runs from the house screaming. Gloria and Sasha
follow. As she reaches the lawn, clothes and accessories come
raining down. Ken is tossing all her stuff off the third
floor.

obsessively calls them by their proper names, of course.

Ken Ryan Gosling collapses in a pool of emotion. Barbie
Margot runs crying. Gloria and Sasha follow. Gloria tries to
comfort her. Barbie Margot turns on Gloria, angry:

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          I didn't wish anything! I've never
          wanted anything to change.

Barbie Margot drops listlessly into a sitting position, tips
over and lies flat like a doll.

<b>EXT. BARBIE KEN LAND STREET. DAY.

Weird Barbie patrols in a vehicle version of her house,
constructed from abandoned Barbie cars. It's kind of like a
tank, very Road Warrior.

It rumbles past a Ken taking down "Barbie Way" and putting up
a "Ken Avenue Boulevard Road Mews" sign. They screech to a
halt beside a catatonic Barbie Margot:

Gloria and Sasha are driving down the Barbie highway in
Barbie's car. Gloria and Sasha (!!!) sing at the top of their
lungs to the Indigo Girls.

Sasha looks almost wistfully at the retreating landscape of
Barbie Land.

Suddenly the song on the radio is cut out by a needle
scratch. Gloria frowns. A Ken comes over the airwaves.

speakers. Allan pops up in the backseat:

<b>                    ALLAN
</b><b>          TURN THIS SONG OFF FOR CHRISTSAKE!

Gloria and Sasha scream their heads off and Allan screams at
their screaming. So much screaming! They skid off the road,
crashing down a hill, flipping over a few times and landing
upright on another road. (SAME SHOT AS THE FIRST TIME.)
Except for this time, the car lands with no one in it, and
ONE second later, right beside the car, in the same
configuration, land Gloria, Sasha, & Allan.

Up ahead the Kens are building a wall. It's partially
constructed, and hard hat Kens hammer and dig.

          Just get in the car and keep it
          singing... be ready for anything.

Allan charges at the Kens and takes them all on, rather
impressively. Gloria and Sasha scramble to the car. Sasha
lands in the driver's seat and REVS:

toward the remaining beleaguered Kens.

And he turns and runs back to the car.

Gloria and Sasha beam at each other. Sasha steps on the gas,
turns the wheel and they swing back toward Barbie Land.

<b>INT. WEIRD BARBIE'S WEIRDHOUSE. DAY
</b>
Barbie Margot has joined Weird Barbie and her motley crew -
the reject Barbies, Earring Magic Ken, Sugar Daddy Ken,
Growing up Skipper -- her boobs grow when she lifts her arm --
Teen Talk Barbie, Tanner the pooping Dog, Video Girl Barbie.

Barbie Margot is lying on the floor, unable to do anything,
totally without any will to live. Teen Talk Barbie and Video
Girl Barbie attempt to un-brainwash Barbie Alexandra.

<b>                    TEEN TALK BARBIE
</b>              (to Barbie Alexandra)
          You're a writer. This is your Nobel
          Prize. Remember?
<b>                                                        83.

Barbie Alexandra goes into one of those acceptance speeches
women give, totally self-effacing and not embracing the win.

<b>                    BARBIE ALEXANDRA
</b>          Oh my God, I don't even know how I
          got here. I don't deserve this! I'd
          like to thank Ken.

<b>                     WEIRD BARBIE
</b>               (entering the room)
          It's pointless trying to deprogram
          her. I've already tried.
               (looking at Barbie Margot)
          The fork in my soup is this, Barb:
          why didn't the brainwashing work on
          you?

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>              (still face down)
          My exposure to Patriarchy in the
          real world made me immune. Either
          you're brainwashed or you're weird
          and ugly. There is no in-between.

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          Sing it sister.
              (to the group)
          Get ready to live in the shadows
          and on the margins because in 48
          hours Barbie Land becomes Ken Land.

They hear voices. Everyone screams and then tries to hide,
badly. Except for Barbie Margot, who doesn't move. Other
Barbies step over her. Some try to freeze like statues.

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          It's the Kens! They've found us!

The sound of footsteps grow louder. Until finally Gloria,
Sasha and Allan are standing there.

<b>                       WEIRD BARBIE
</b><b>          HUMANS!
</b>
<b>                       ALLAN
</b><b>          AND ALLAN!

The lights go on and they all emerge out of their random
hiding places. Barbie Margot half clocks Gloria and Sasha and
tries to pull herself away, out of their sight.
<b>                                                        84.

Again, we take in the group as Gloria identifies each one --

<b>                    GLORIA
</b>          That's Sugar Daddy Ken! And Earring

</b>          No, no, I'm not a Sugar Daddy. This
          is Sugar.
              (holding up a dog)
          And I'm her Daddy.

<b>                    EARRING MAGIC KEN

          earring.

          Yeah, those were actual Kens.
              (identifying all of them)
          And-- more discontinued Barbies!!
          Growing Up Skipper?! May I?
              (to Sasha)
          Watch this!

Gloria lifts Growing Up Skipper's arm and her boobs inflate.
This is as weird as it sounds.

<b>                    GLORIA
</b>          See! Her boobs grow!

<b>                    SASHA
</b>              (aghast)
          Why would they do that?

Gloria continues down the line of discontinued Barbies.

<b>                    GLORIA
</b>          And Barbie Video Girl!

<b>                    BARBIE VIDEO GIRL

          whose dream that is? Nobody. It's
          nobody's dream.

<b>                    WEIRD BARBIE
</b>          And that's Barbie Barbie, of
          course... she's not dead she's just
          having an existential crisis.

Gloria and Sasha walk over to Barbie Margot who hasn't gotten
very far. She just presses her face to the ground.

Gloria turns her over. Barbie Margot hides her face with her
hands. Gloria gently moves them away.

And there is unadorned Barbie Margot, no makeup, nothing
special just her (which WE KNOW is INSANELY BEAUTIFUL, don't
worry.) Barbie Margot totally falls apart weeping. Like a
toddler crying.

          Like we have to always be
          extraordinary and somehow we're
          always doing it wrong. You're
          supposed to be THIN but not TOO
          THIN and you can never say you want
          to be THIN you have to say you want

          BE thin. You have to have money but
          you can't ask for money because
          that's crass. You have to be a boss
          but you can't be mean. You're

          squash other people's ideas. You're
          supposed to LOVE being a mother but
          don't talk about your kids all the
          damn time. You're supposed to be a
          career woman but always be looking
          out for other people. You have to
          answer for men's bad behavior,
          which is INSANE, but if you point
          that out then you're accused of
          complaining. You're supposed to be
          pretty for men but not SO pretty
          that you tempt them too much or
          threaten other women. You're
          supposed to be part of the
          sisterhood but also stand out but
          also always be grateful. You have
          to never get old never be rude
          never show off never be selfish

          show fear never get out of line.

          not only are you doing it all wrong
          but that everything is also YOUR

Exhausted, she sits down. Allan is in tears, they all are.
Maybe a slow clap? And then:

<b>                    BARBIE ALEXANDRA
</b>          Wait, I did write a book.
              (rubbing her eyes)
          It was like I was in some dream

          in the Zack Snyder cut of Justice
          League.

               to Gloria)

Sasha looks at her mom like she's seeing her for the first
time. She is proud.

Barbie Margot stands up. And we MOVE in on her pure, tear-
streaked face.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          By giving voice to the cognitive
          dissonance required to be a woman
          under the patriarchy, you robbed it
          of it's power.

Gloria, Sasha and everyone else turns to Barbie Margot:

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT

          Woah, I just said all of that.

          saving.

Sasha fist bumps her. Barbie Margot is amazed. She suddenly
has new authority, a deeper voice, from a place of real
knowing, like Olivia de Havilland at the end of "The
Heiress." (Now, go watch that movie!)

<b>                     BARBIE MARGOT

          key.

A large 3D map of Barbie Land opens up (like a Murphy bed)
from the wall.

CUT TO: HEIST MONTAGE. We see the execution of the plan as
Barbie Margot, Gloria and Sasha lay out the details. (You

CUT TO: The Barbie Busytown Street. The "heist Barbies" pile
out of Weird Barbie's tank-car. Barbie Alexandra sits in a
cafe on her laptop. She nods to the "heist Barbies" as Ken
Simu strolls by with Barbie Issa.

<b>                    KEN SIMU

Gloria de-programs her:

In a Ken Mojo Dojo Casa House, Ken Kingsley sits with Barbie

movie.

crumples on the sand. Everyone looks at each other.

<b>                    MATTEL EXECUTIVE #1

          weapons here?

<b>EXT. BARBIE LAND. BEACH. INTERCUT
</b>
The Kens continue to do "battle" with Ken Ryan Gosling
singing his heart out.

This transitions into a "dream ballet" in a white space. The
Kens dance in an expression of frustrated masculinity,
helplessness, and feeling.

It culminates in dance-off and Ken Anthem. It's beautiful,
actually. It's broken by:

<b>                      KEN KINGSLEY
</b><b>          KEN! KEN!
</b>
We're back on the beach. The Kens hold hands post dream
ballet, Ken Ryan Gosling still in the feeling, Ken Kingsley
comes running over to him.

<b>                    KEN KINGSLEY
</b>          KEN! Weren't we supposed to vote
          today?

<b>                      KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          What?

<b>                    KEN KINGSLEY
</b>          To change the constitution?!

<b>INT. BARBIE SUPREME COURT. BARBIE/KEN LAND. DAY
</b>
We move through the crowd of enthusiastic Barbies. "The last
time I saw you you were brain washed! So were you!

You look so much better not in the cheerleader costume! And
you without the school girl outfit!"

Barbie Issa bangs the gavel, casually and glamorously
commanding.

<b>                    BARBIE ISSA
</b>          OK ladies, let's do this. All those
          in favor of letting Barbie Land be
          Barbie Land, say "Aye!"

The Barbies all say "aye" voting to retain the constitution.
Sasha grabs her mom's hand. She has a tear running down her
cheek.

Barbie Margot smiles. That's what she wanted to show them.

<b>EXT. BARBIE DREAMHOUSE. DAY
</b>
The Kens, in musical dance pack, approach the cul-de-sac as
if they're riding horses, but they're just galloping on foot
Monty Python style...

As they arrive, they look up and down and all around to
discover that the Barbies (plus Allan and Sasha and Gloria
and the rejected dolls) are now occupying all the houses.

The whole aesthetic is now a combination of Mojo Dojo Casa
House PLUS Dreamhouse PLUS Weirdhouse. It's a combo-pack,
which is actually the most beautiful of all.

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING

          Is it my imagination, or are these
          Mojo Dojo Casa Houses...
          dreamier???

The Barbies all step out into the open.

<b>                    BARBIE ISSA
</b>              (from on high)
          That's because they're Dream

          of Barbie Land the way it was MEANT

All the Barbies cheer!

          houses.

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING

They all slowly, tiredly line themselves up.

<b>                    KEN KINGSLEY
</b>          Who are we attacking, sir?

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          The--

Ken Ryan Gosling looks at the Barbies, triumphant, but not
confrontational.

He hesitates. He looks back at the Kens who look exhausted
and confused. Suddenly he sees the folly of everything. The
other Kens look sheepish, as well. They look like the kids at
the end of Lord of The Flies when the ship comes.

Ken Ryan Gosling starts crying and runs past Barbie Margot
into the Dreamhouse.

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b><b>          DON'T LOOK AT ME!!!!!
</b>
Which makes Allan cry. Barbie Margot goes into the Dreamhouse
to comfort him:

Ken Ryan Gosling is lying face down on the bed.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>              (to Ken Ryan Gosling)
          Hey, are you okay?

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>              (snort)
          Yeah... I'm fine. Totally.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          It's OK if you're crying. I cried
          too. It's kind of amazing.

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>              (sobbing)
          I know. I'm a liberated man. I know
          crying isn't weak.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Do you want to sit up for a minute?
<b>                                                       104.

He does.

<b>                     KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>               (still crying)
           It was hard running stuff. I didn't
           love it.

<b>                        BARBIE MARGOT
</b>           I get it.

<b>                     KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>               (crying harder)
           And those mini-fridges are so
           small! You can only fit like a six-
           pack in them, and the freezers are
           basically USELESS. And, to be
           honest, once I found out patriarchy
           isn't about horses, I kind of lost
           interest anyway...

He heaves and ugly cries, snot dripping from his nose. Barbie
Margot tries to comfort him but kind of realizes she should
just let this finish on its own.

<b>                        BARBIE MARGOT
</b>           That's OK!

<b>                     KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>           I always thought this would be our
           house.

<b>                      BARBIE MARGOT
</b>           Oh... Ken.
               (gently)
           I think I owe you an apology. I'm
           sorry I took you for granted. Not
           every night had to be girl's night.

Ken wipes his tears, nods a thank you. We see that Ken is
reflected in Barbie's eye - Ken sees it too. He leans in for
a kiss. She backs away.

<b>                     BARBIE MARGOT
</b>           No, I didn't mean to suggest--

<b>                     KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>               (standing up)
           I don't know who I am without you!

<b>                     BARBIE MARGOT
</b>           You're Ken.
<b>                                                            105.
</b>

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          But it's Barbie AND Ken. There is
          no just Ken. That's why I was
          created - I only exist within the
          warmth of your gaze. Without you
          I'm just some blonde guy who can't
          do flips.

Ken Ryan Gosling runs to the edge of the house, dramatically.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Maybe it's time for you to discover
          who Ken is.

Ken leans in AGAIN for the kiss.

<b>        BARBIE MARGOT                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>No-- That's not what I'm--        OK, I think I got it.

Ken is bursting with feeling, leaning over a few more times
to try to kiss her even though he knows that's not the
solution. He just tries to accept it. He looks crazy.

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          I feel so stupid. I look SO stupid.
<b>          I LOOK SO STUPID!!!!

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Ken, you have to figure out who you
          are without me. You're not your
          girlfriend, you're not your house,
          you're not your mink.

<b>                       KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          Beach?

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          No, not even beach. Maybe all the
          things you thought made you you
          aren't... really you. Maybe it's
          Barbie AND... it's Ken.

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          Ken... is me?

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT

</b>          And ME!

<b>                       KEN SIMU
</b>          And ME!

Ken Ryan Gosling clutches his mink in his arms as he looks
down to Ken Kingsley. And then he tosses it dramatically into
the air.

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          I want you to have it.

Ken Kingsley dons the faux mink coat. He turns to the crowd:

<b>                    KEN KINGSLEY
</b>              (with all the gravitas)
          We were only fighting because we
          didn't know who we were.

Ken Ryan Gosling goes down the slide

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          Ken is me!!!!

Suddenly, there is clapping. And weeping. The Mattel CEO
exits the treehouse. He is somehow clapping and weeping the
hardest.

<b>                    MATTEL CEO
</b>              (weeping)
          Ken is RIGHT. It is SO HARD to be a
          leader.

He sees Midge standing next to him, screams.

<b>                    MATTEL CEO
</b>          AHHHH!!!! Midge. God. I thought we
          discontinued her.
              (recovering)
          Do you know how many times I've
          just wanted to stand up in a board
          meeting and say, "Let's just tickle
          each other!" Let's have a company
          retreat and just tickle each other!

</b>

The Mattel execs all join in and tickle their CEO, who is
giggling like a little kid. Aaron Dinkins' tickle turning
into a hug:

<b>                    MATTEL CEO
</b>          NO NO NO don't hug me!
              (moving on...)
          But thanks to the Barbies I too can
          relieve myself of this heavy
          existential burden while holding
          onto the very real title of CEO and
          we can restore everything in Barbie

          of the operation.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          So you're...?

<b>                    RUTH
</b>              (little bow)
          Ruth Handler, inventor of Barbie.

<b>                    MATTEL CEO
</b>              (stage whisper)
          Her ghost keeps an office on the
          17th floor.

Whispers and looks amongst the Barbies and Kens.

<b>                    RUTH
</b>          What? You think the lady who
          invented Barbie looked like Barbie?
          Ha! I'm a five foot nothing Grandma
          with a double mastectomy and tax
          evasion issues. Nobody looks like
          Barbie. Except, of course, Barbie.
          Take a bow, honey.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          I don't feel like Barbie though,
          not anymore.

Ruth gestures to Barbie Margot.

<b>                    RUTH
</b>          Walk with me.
<b>                                                       111.
</b>

Barbie takes Ruth's hand. They head down the road. The cul-de-
sac of Barbies and Kens and Mattel all do a slow theater wave
goodbye. Ken Ryan waves, heartfelt:

<b>                    KEN RYAN GOSLING
</b>          Thank you, Barbie. Thank you.

<b>INT. ORIGIN SPACE
</b>
A vast empty space, almost like reflecting sand on a beach,
softly illuminated by different, changing colors.

<b>                    RUTH
</b>          Tell me your troubles.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Is this therapy?

<b>                     RUTH
</b>          No, you're talking to a ghost from
          the 1950s!

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Well, I don't know what I'm
          supposed to do... I've always just
          been Stereotypical Barbie, I don't
          think I'm good at anything else.

<b>                    RUTH
</b>          You saved Barbie Land from
          patriarchy.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          That was very much a group effort.

<b>                    RUTH
</b>          And you helped that Mother and
          Daughter connect.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          They really helped each other.

<b>                    RUTH
</b>          Maybe you're Self-Effacing Barbie?

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Maybe I'm not Barbie anymore.

Barbie Margot says this before she realized that she'd said
it and then immediately realizes it's true.

<b>                    RUTH
</b>          You understand that humans only
          have one ending.
<b>                    (MORE)
</b><b>                                      112.
</b><b>          RUTH (CONT'D)
</b>Ideas live forever, humans, not so
much. You know that right?

<b>          BARBIE MARGOT
</b>I do.

<b>          RUTH
</b>Being a human can be pretty
uncomfortable.

<b>          BARBIE MARGOT
</b>I know.

<b>          RUTH
</b>I mean humans make things up like
patriarchy and Barbie just to deal
with how uncomfortable it is.

<b>          BARBIE MARGOT
</b>I understand.

<b>          RUTH
</b>And then you die.

<b>          BARBIE MARGOT
</b>    (nodding)
I want... I want to be part of the
people that make meaning, not the
thing that's made. I want to be the
one imagining, not the idea itself.
Does that make sense?

<b>          RUTH
</b>    (chuckling)
I always knew that Barbie would
surprise me, but I never expected
this.

<b>          BARBIE MARGOT
</b>Do you give me permission? To
become human?

<b>          RUTH
</b>You don't need my permission.

<b>          BARBIE MARGOT
</b>But you're The Creator. You control
me.

<b>          RUTH
</b>Ha! I can't control you any more
than I could control my own
daughter! I named you after her -
Barbara.
<b>          (MORE)
</b><b>                                                       113.
</b><b>                      RUTH (CONT'D)
</b>            And I always hoped for you like I
            hoped for her. We mothers stand
            still so our daughters can look
            back to see how far they've come.

<b>                      BARBIE MARGOT
</b>                (figuring it out)
            So being human isn't something I
            need to ask for or even want, it's
            something I discover I am...?

<b>                      RUTH
</b>            I can't, in good conscience, let
            you take that leap without knowing
            what it means. Take my hands.

She does.

<b>                      RUTH
</b>            Now close your eyes.

She does.

<b>                      RUTH
</b>            Now... FEEL.

We see details of Barbie Margot, her eye, her forearm, her
pulse. Life.

And she feels and sees what a human life is. The joy and pain
of being mortal. All that she will lose and gain.

We see FLASHES of life lived, unadorned home footage of many
women's lives - happiness, sadness, big moments, little
moments, childhood, adulthood, old age, how it all rushes by
in one moment, each life drifting into the next somehow
capturing the current that runs through all things.

BACK TO BARBIE: Tears roll down Barbie Margot's face. She
opens her eyes and says one thing:

<b>                      BARBIE MARGOT
</b><b>            YES.
</b>
<b>EXT. REAL WORLD. LOS ANGELES. DAY
</b>
We BOOM down to the streets of LA.

<b>                      HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)
</b>            So Barbie left behind the pastels
            and plastic of Barbie Land for the
            pastels and plastic of Los Angeles.
<b>                                                       114.

Gloria pulls up to the curb. Nerdy Well Meaning Dad rides
shotgun, Sasha and Barbie Margot in the backseat.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>              (excited, anxious)
          Well, thanks for the lift.

<b>           GLORIA                          SASHA
</b>You've got this.               I'm so proud of you.

<b>                    NERDY WELL MEANING DAD
</b>          Estoy muy orgullosa de ti.

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Thank you, you guys are the best.
          Ok, lets do this.

<b>                    NERDY WELL MEANING DAD
</b>          S� se puede!

<b>                    GLORIA
</b>          That's a political statement.

<b>                    SASHA
</b>          That's appropriation, Dad!

They all cheer her on as she walks from the car into a big
building. We see that she's wearing Birkenstocks - PINK, of
course, but still, Birks.

<b>INT. OFFICE. CONTINUOUS.
</b>
Nervous, happy, she finds the right door, and walks up to a
reception desk. To the woman behind the glass:

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Hi...

<b>                    RECEPTIONIST
</b>          Name?

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          Oh, um, Handler comma Barbara.

<b>                    RECEPTIONIST
</b>          And what are you here for today,
          Barbara?

And then she says, with so much pride, so much anticipation,
so much meaning, so much deep joy:

<b>                    BARBIE MARGOT
</b>          I'm here to see my gynecologist.
<b>                                                       115.
</b>

<b>CUT TO BLACK BEFORE ANYONE CAN EVEN PROCESS THAT SENTENCE.
</b>


The End.
