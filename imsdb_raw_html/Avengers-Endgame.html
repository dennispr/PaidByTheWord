<b>EXT. BARTON HOME - DAY
</b>
<b>CLOSE ON: A HOUSE-ARREST ANKLE BRACELET.
</b>
<b>                    CLINT BARTON (O.S.)
</b>          Okay, you see where you're going?
          Let's work on how to get there.

Pan up to find...CLINT BARTON, with his daughter, LILA,
coaching her as she notches an arrow in her bow.

<b>                    CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay, good...tip down...bow arm
          out...three fingers-

<b>                       LILA BARTON
</b>          Why three?

<b>                    CLINT BARTON
</b>          `Cause two's not enough and four's
          too much-

<b>                    LAURA BARTON (O.S.)
</b>          You guys want mustard or mayo, or
          both?

CLINT TURNS. IN THE FIELD BEHIND THEM, his wife, LAURA
BARTON sets up a picnic as COOPER and NATHANIEL play soccer.

<b>                    LILA BARTON
</b>          Who puts mayo on a hot dog?

<b>                     CLINT BARTON
</b>          We'll both have mustard, hon!
              (to Lila)
          Okay. Draw back, deep breath...

She lets loose.   THUD!   HER ARROW HITS NEAR THE BULLS-EYE.

<b>                    CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
</b>          Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your
          arrow.

<b>                    LAURA BARTON (O.S.)
</b>          Enough murder practice! Soup's on!

<b>                    CLINT BARTON
</b>          One sec, babe. Be right there!
          We're gonna kill some hot dogs.
          We're hungry.

But when he turns back...LILA IS GONE.   The bow and arrow lie
at his feet. He stares.
<b>                                                               2
</b>

<b>                         CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
</b>             Lila?    Babe, did you see Lila-

He turns to his wife, BUT SHE'S GONE. So are the boys.        The
soccer ball rolls to a stop near the picnic blanket.

<b>NO ONE CAN BE SEEN FOR A HUNDRED YARDS IN ALL DIRECTIONS.
</b>
<b>                         CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
</b>             Guys?    Guys, come on...

Clint walks toward the field, dread growing.

<b>                         CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
</b>             Laura?

Clint breaks into a panicked run.

<b>TITLE: "TWENTY-TWO DAYS LATER."
</b>
Soon, THE BENATAR tumbles past, adrift...


<b>INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
TONY STARK and NEBULA play table-top football.     She wins.

<b>                        TONY
</b>                 (offering his hand)
             Good sport. Have fun?

Nebula studies his hand, confused.      Finally she shakes.

<b>                       NEBULA
</b>             It was fun.


<b>INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
</b>
Tony, thin and haggard, kneels in front of HIS BROKEN IRON
MAN HELMET. He hits a switch. A light blinks.
<b>                                                             3
</b>

TONY'S RECORDING: he stares directly into the "camera."

<b>                    TONY
</b>          This thing on? Hey, Ms. Potts.
          Pep. If you find this recording,
          don't post it on social media.
          It's going to be a real tearjerker.


<b>EXT. SPACE - NIGHT
</b>
THE BENATAR sparks, adrift.

<b>                    TONY (O.S.)
</b>          I don't know if you're ever going
          to see these. I don't even know if
          you're still...God, I hope so.
          Today's day twenty-one, no...twenty-
          two.


<b>INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK
</b>
NEBULA lasers shut Tony's infected wound.

<b>                    TONY (O.S.)
</b>          You know, if it wasn't for the
          existential terror of staring into
          the literal void of space, I'd say
          I'm feeling a little better today.
          Infection's run its course, thanks
          to the Blue Meanie back there.
          You'd like her. She's very
          practical. And only a tiny bit
          sadistic.


<b>INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK
</b>
<b>TONY AND NEBULA MEND THE EMPTY FUEL CELLS UNDER THE FLOOR.
</b>
<b>                    TONY (O.S.)
</b>          The fuel cells were cracked during
          battle, but we figured out a way to
          reverse the ion charge. Bought
          ourselves about 48 hours of flight
          time. Problem is that was
          about...49 hours ago.


<b>EXT. SPACE - NIGHT
</b>
<b>FROM HIGH OVERHEAD, WE WATCH THE BENATAR DRIFT IN SPACE.
</b><b>                                                             4
</b>

<b>                    TONY (O.S.)
</b>          Which means, we're dead in the
          water. A thousand light years from
          the nearest 7-11.


<b>INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK
</b>
Tony hands Nebula the last of A PURPLE POWDER.   She pushes it
back to him.

<b>                    TONY (O.S.)
</b>          Most of the quote-unquote `food'
          and potable water ran out two weeks
          ago.


<b>INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
</b>
Tony stands on the flight deck, one hand resting on the
glass, staring into the unknown.

<b>                    TONY
</b>          Pep, I know I said no more
          surprises. But, I gotta say, I was
          really hoping to pull off one last
          one. But it looks like...well, you
          know what it looks like.


<b>INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
</b>
Back to now.   Tony records his thoughts into his helmet.

<b>                    TONY
</b>          Don't feel bad about this. I mean,
          actually, if you grovel for a
          couple weeks, and then move on with
          enormous guilt...I should probably
          lie down for a minute, rest my
          eyes. Please know, when I drift
          off, it will be like every day
          lately. I'm fine, totally fine.
          I'm going to dream about you. It's
          always you.

Tony switches the helmet off.

<b>                                                 TIME CUT:
</b>
NEBULA finds TONY SPRAWLED ON THE FLOOR.

<b>                                                 TIME CUT:

</b>

Nebula helps Tony into Quill's chair. Tony slumps,
completely still. Nebula gives him his privacy.

Move in on Tony's face as...A LIGHT SLOWLY GROWS BRIGHTER.
Soon, the entire flight deck glows as bright as a sun.

Nebula appears from the galley, shading her eyes. Tony's
eyelids flutter. Finally, he opens them to see...

CAPTAIN MARVEL (CAROL DANVERS) hovering in space.


<b>INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
STEVE ROGERS shaves.

He studies himself in the mirror, exhausted. He's about to
tap his razor in the sink's standing water, when...

THE WATER RIPPLES. Steve stares a beat, puzzled.      Then the
lamp catches his eye...SWAYING GENTLY.

Just then, a sound roars overhead.   Steve turns...


<b>EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
THE MOON HANGS HUGE OVER THE EARTH. Then the silhouette of
THE BENATAR races past, propelled by CAROL DANVERS.

Below...STEVE ROGERS, BRUCE BANNER, AND NATASHA ROMANOV watch
a flying woman guide the ship to the ground.

Behind them, PEPPER POTTS walks up to the group.

<b>                                                   TIME CUT:
</b>
Steve races up as NEBULA helps Tony down the ramp.

<b>                    TONY
</b>          I couldn't stop him.

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          Neither could we.

<b>                    TONY
</b>          I lost the kid.

<b>                     STEVE
</b>              (unable to say it all)
          We...lost...

<b>                    TONY

<b>                                                              6
</b>

<b>JUST THEN, PEPPER POTTS THROWS HERSELF INTO TONY'S ARMS.
</b>
<b>                    PEPPER POTTS
</b>          Stay here, you stay right here-

<b>                    TONY
</b>          I'm not going anywhere.

NEARBY, NEBULA watches the sad humans. ROCKET SITS BESIDE
HER, GRATEFUL. She rests a hand on his furry head.


<b>INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY
</b>
RHODEY, TONY, STEVE, NATASHA, AND CAROL watch...

<b>A HOLO-DISPLAY ROTATING THROUGH FACES OF PEOPLE WE'VE LOST:

<b>                    RHODEY
</b>          It's been twenty-three days since
          Thanos came to Earth.

TONY, weak, sits in a hi-tech wheelchair, IV dripping into
his arm. He stares, taking in the loss:

<b>SAM WILSON. SECRETARY ROSS. SHARON CARTER.      SCOTT LANG.
</b><b>HOPE VAN DYNE. HANK PYM. NICK FURY.
</b>
At Fury, Carol bites back emotion.

<b>                    NATASHA
</b>          World governments are in pieces, as
          you can imagine. But the parts
          that still work are trying to take
          a census. It looks like he did
          what he said he was going to do.

<b>JANE FOSTER. ERIK SELVIG. WONG. DR. STRANGE. THE BARTON
</b><b>FAMILY. QUILL. DRAX. MANTIS. GROOT. PETER PARKER.

Finally, Tony looks away.   RHODEY turns it off.

</b>          Where is he now?

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          We don't know. He just opened a

Tony looks out to see...THOR on the patio.

<b>                    TONY
</b>          What's his deal?

<b>                    ROCKET (O.S.)

Tony turns to see Rocket for the first time.

<b>                    ROCKET (CONT'D)
</b>          He thinks he failed. Which, of

          of that going around, ain't there?

<b>                    TONY

THE CAMERA ROTATES down from the sky onto a strangely quiet
San Francisco, until it finds...A STORAGE WAREHOUSE.

THROUGH THE VAN WINDOWS, we see...HANK PYM'S QUANTUM TUNNEL.

THE BACK DOORS OF THE VAN BLOW OPEN, revealing...SCOTT LANG,
ANT-MAN suit shorting. He retracts his helmet, gasping.

A GUARD reads THE TERMINAL BEACH, by J.G. Ballard. He looks
up at a monitor: SCOTT LANG holds up a sign, "HELP."

A dented WAGON rolls over a speed-bump. Scott, in his old

The Guard watches him go, puzzled.

Scott walks A STREET OF ABANDONED HOMES.

He hears A CLACKING. A KID on a bicycle rides by, playing
card wedged between his spokes.

Scott waves him down.   The kid stops.

He scans the "L's," finally finding, "SCOTT LANG."

He leaps a bush, banging on the front door.

Scott wraps his arms around CASSIE LANG (14), now five years
older than when he last saw her. She hugs him, CRYING.

          all your high hopes won't help me
          if there's no logical, tangible way

</b>          Great. You show us where it is,

The figure removes his hood, revealing...THE RED SKULL.

<b>                    RED SKULL

CLINT staring down from the ALTAR.

<b>                    RED SKULL
</b>          What you seek lies in front of you.

          behind that which you love.

<b>                    CLINT BARTON

</b>          I didn't.
              (off his look)
          Thanos left here with the stone,
          and without his daughter. You
          really think that's a coincidence?

They both look out at the well, heavy.

Natasha goes to Clint, resolved.

<b>                    NATASHA
</b>          If we don't get the stone, billions
          of people are going to stay dead.

<b>                     CLINT BARTON

<b>                     NATASHA
</b>          Yeah.   Guess we do.

<b>                    CLINT BARTON
</b>          I'm starting to think we don't mean
          the same person.

<b>                    NATASHA
</b>          For the last five years, I've been

          right here. This is all it's been
          about. Bringing everybody back.

<b>                    CLINT BARTON

<b>                    NATASHA

</b>          And I don't want you to.
              (beat)
          Nat. You know what I've done.
          What I am now. Your life's worth
          ten of mine-

<b>                    NATASHA
</b>          I don't judge people by their worst

</b>          You're a pain in my ass, you know
          that?

She relaxes for the briefest moment.   Just then, CLINT SWEEPS
<b>OUT HER LEGS, PINNING HER DOWN.
</b>
<b>                    CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)

<b>SHE REVERSES, SENDING HIM TUMBLING.
</b>
<b>                    NATASHA

<b>BOOM!   AN EXPLODING ARROW KNOCKS HER OFF HER FEET.
</b>
Clint races past her...leaping off edge of the cliff.   Just
as he falls...

NATASHA TACKLES HIM IN MID-AIR. They drop, but NATASHA
<b>SHOOTS HER GRAPPLING LINE INTO THE CLIFF.
</b>
THEY SLAM INTO THE CLIFFSIDE. She attaches the other end of
her grappling line to Clint's belt...saving his life.

She slides, but he reaches out and grabs her...saving hers.

<b>                        CLINT BARTON
</b>           Damn you.

They hang there a long, terrible moment. CLINT'S GRASP
STARTS TO LOOSEN. Finally, she looks him in the eye.

<b>                        NATASHA
</b>           Let me go.

<b>                      CLINT BARTON
</b>           No.   Please no...

The two friends stare at each other, a lifetime between them.

<b>                     NATASHA
</b>           It's okay...

<b>                     CLINT BARTON
</b>           Natasha, no-

Then Natasha Romanoff kicks off the cliff wall, yanking out
of Clint's grasp.

She falls...

Clint dangles from the grappling hook, staring down,
helpless, stifling his scream.

<b>WHOOSH!   THE WHOLE WORLD GOES WHITE.

<b>EXT. VORMIR, BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY

When the light fades, CLINT LIES FLOATING IN SPACE. The

CLINT LIES IN THE POOL AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN. He sits
up and opens his hand to see THE SOUL STONE. His eyes well.

THANOS stares, almost sad, as Steve tightens the broken

           time stamp. He should be here.

<b>                     SAM WILSON
</b>           Get him back!

<b>                     SMART HULK
</b>           I'm trying.

<b>                     SAM WILSON

<b>                     SMART HULK
</b><b>           I'M TRYING!

Just then...Bucky looks out to the water.

<b>                      BUCKY BARNES
</b>           Sam.

Sam turns...


<b>EXT AVENGERS COMPOUND, RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Work crews have cleared a space overlooking the river.
There, AN OLD MAN sits on a bench, staring out at the Hudson.
<b>                                                           144
</b>

Move around him to find SAM watching from A FEW YARDS AWAY.

<b>                      SAM WILSON
</b>          Hey, Cap.

The man turns and we now see: STEVE ROGERS, age 112.

<b>                      OLD STEVE
</b>          Hi, Sam.

<b>                    SAM WILSON
</b>          Something go wrong...or something
          go right?

<b>                     OLD STEVE
</b>          I thought, after everything that's
          happened...maybe I should try out
          some of that life Tony always told
          me to get.

<b>                    SAM WILSON
</b>          How was it?

Steve looks at the river, 112 years of emotion in his face.

<b>                    OLD STEVE
</b>          It was beautiful.

<b>                    SAM WILSON
</b>          I'm happy for you. Really.

<b>                      OLD STEVE
</b>          Thanks.

<b>                    SAM WILSON
</b>          Only thing bumming me out is now I
          live in a world without Captain
          America.

Steve pulls up A CASE from beside him, giving it to Sam.

<b>                    OLD STEVE
</b>          That's kind of why I'm here.

Sam unzips it, revealing...A BRAND NEW SHIELD.

<b>                    SAM WILSON
</b>          Where did you even get this?

<b>                     OLD STEVE
</b>          I had a little time to travel.
              (beat)
          Try it on.
<b>                                                             145
</b>

Sam hesitates. He glances back at Bucky, who nods.    Then Sam
picks up the shield...and puts it on.

<b>                    OLD STEVE (CONT'D)
</b>          How does it feel?

<b>                    SAM WILSON
</b>          Like it's someone else's.

<b>                       OLD STEVE
</b>          It isn't.

Sam tries to check his emotion.    He shakes Steve's hand.

<b>                       SAM WILSON
</b>          Thank you.     I'll try my best.

Steve rests his other hand on Sam's.

<b>                    OLD STEVE
</b>          That's why it's yours.

Sam smiles, noticing...STEVE'S TARNISHED WEDDING RING.

<b>                    SAM WILSON
</b>          You gonna tell me about her?

Steve smiles to himself at the end of a long, long life.

<b>                     OLD STEVE
</b>          Nope.   I don't think I will.

A TEA CUP LIES SHATTERED on the hardwood. We hear Harry
James. Move into the living room...past the record player...

TO WHERE STEVE DANCES WITH A WOMAN. They rock back and forth
barely moving. As they turn, we see...

PEGGY CARTER, tears streaming down her face. He steps on her
toe. She laughs. As they turn, we get a good look at...

Steve Rogers, eyes shut, finally getting the life he
deserves.
