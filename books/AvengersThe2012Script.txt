This seems to be more or less the final film. According to Whedon, the original script- written by Zak Penn- was so bad that he forgot it ever happened and re-wrote it entirely in his vision. Jabulani Pongolani (7 out of 10 ) A good film, action driven but the end of it all is not quite convincing. Why save Loki's skin. A villian just steps away scot-free. Though Loki is sent back to his other world his face masked that's not convincing enough. DB (1 out of 10 ) I'm not sure, but this script seems like it might be fake. It doesn't read like a script written by Joss Whedon. Anonymous (10 out of 10 ) I really like this movie. I think it is very good and funny. It is great to tie together different heroes in the same universe, and it sets up nicely for the next films.
