Andrew (2 out of 10 ) Jurassic Park is... a classic, but that is about it. Just watch it to say that you've seen it. I do like the sequels better. Ravyn (10 out of 10 ) It may be a classic but it was popular and still is. ev (10 out of 10 ) Yes, very big classic indeed. FJ (6 out of 10 ) If they had made the films a bit more accurate to the books, not only would they be 18 but they'd be much much better. Good film though, not too keen on the sequels, got to give them something for their creation of the dinosaurs. Not all CGI, good guys. Chris Stanley (10 out of 10 ) One of the best movies ever made. Jurassic Park Fanatic (10 out of 10 ) It scared me when I was 7 but it became an addiction. Call me strange but if I don't see it at least once a day I go nuts! Ok so I don't get scared any more, because when I was about 10 or 11 I saw how the movie was made. They should have never told us how it was made, it ruins the thrill. Close to every weekend I try to beat my record of how many times I watch it. My record is 18 times from about 9pm on friday to 10pm on sunday. The first one never gets old, however The Lost World, and Jurassic Park III kind of do. Michael H. (10 out of 10 ) It was more then excellent! It was totally COOL. But kinda scary at the same time. Terrific film, Spielberg. Sadhu (10 out of 10 ) This is a very big classic! From the mind of Steven Spielberg, I think this is one of my favorite films. It is very scary, and has great special effects. JPfan#1 (10 out of 10 ) Jurassic Park (the first one) is probably my most favourite film of all times. I've only just started reading the script, but I can tell that it changed a lot from this script to the final product. I'm glad, cause the beginning seemed a bit clich�-ish (I know that's not a word...) Especially the amber and mosquito part. also, it jumps straight to the desert scene. I'm glad they changed it to the raptor in the cage scene, cause that scene was a great way to get the audience hooked.. Matt (9 out of 10 ) Jurassic Park utilized state of the art (for that time) CGI. In-fact, the creators of the CGI created new programs and work-flows specifically for the movie. One of which was an advanced technique which gave the illusion of muscles rippling through skin. Not all of the dinosaurs were CGI, but the T-rex, when it attacks the herd of Gallimimus(sp) was. Rebecca (8 out of 10 ) It is indeed a classic, and when I first saw it, it scared me. Of course, I was like, 7 at the time.. but still. The effects and framework of the dinosaurs is amazing, especially for the time the film was made. But, thing is, its until you read the book.. you think how great the movie is. I read the book about two years ago (being 15 now) and found out just how much better it is in comparison with the movie. Theres a lot more gore, and horror.. especially in the part where that guy gets his guts eaten while he's still alive, that part was class to read. However, I don't think they should re-make this film, but the first time round the storyline and gore should have stayed closer to the book, definitely. Ilamathi Selvan (8 out of 10 ) The kind of critics who sit back and criticize this movie without enjoying it are not human beings at all. If they can't enjoy a simple popcorn movie, it's time they give up their worldly possessions and join some church. It is not without it's flaws. But, I think this movie is one of the best Spielberg movie thanks to the creative imagination of author Michael Crichton and scriptwriter David Koep. I enjoyed it at 7, and still enjoy it at 25. Holly (10 out of 10 ) I simply adore this movie and it's sequels. I've also read the books which are awesome and in a way scarier that the movies. Plus in the books, you get to know everyone's thoughts, which is difficult to convey in the movie. Also, the movie did leave some parts out. But the movies are still great! I think everyone who likes the movie and sequels should read the books too. You'll like them. Holly (10 out of 10 ) I love Jurassic Park and the sequels. I adore the books too. I don't really think you can thoroughly enjoy the movie until you've read the books-but that's just me. The books give you a lot of information you don't get from the movies. I read the books cover to cover to cover about three times each before my brother hid them on me. He told me I was going to wear them out. My favorite of the movies by far is number three. I think it has a lot more action and is a lot scarier than the first two. I can't imagine how that kid must've felt. Ooh, yeah I did the same as Jurassic Park fanatic and watched it every day for about a week once I learned it was only a movie and wasn't going to eat me. Guess that's it. Bye. JJayJ (8 out of 10 ) Unlike others, who focus on the special effects, I like the movie's character development. While Laura Dern is hot, using her as an action hero was forward thinking and well cast. Jeff Goldblum did a great job of balancing his sleazy moves with moral indignation. Then there's Sam Neill's kid-hater to kids-are-cool transformation. And yes...the terror of t-rex cannot be forgotten. Some of the scenes, while exciting, were asking a lot of the viewer ... to suspend our disbelief. But didn't we want to? By the end of the movie ... we were all glad to leave and in the first big screen viewing, I left the theater with that visual hangover. You know...I saw so much that I couldn't stop thinking about it. I kept reliving the scenes again and again until I had to go back...again and again. evan M (10 out of 10 ) I'm sick to death of hearing bad things about this movie. This movie was brought to life out of the great mind of Michael Crichton (who I miss). I say that I do like the second one more. But the first one was better. The third one was just unnecessary. This movie was great. Let's leave it at that. Karthik (10 out of 10 ) Absolutely out of world movie. When I was watching this movie, got myself into movie along with characters and I also had a feeling of relief as like characters when they moves out the island in climax scene. What a sound effect, fabulous and stunning performance by actors. From this movie onwards Spielberg is the role model to me and normally I won't attract to anything. This movie, believe it or not I watched it for more than 25 times. Still its one of my everlasting movie, ofcourse for my whole life. George (10 out of 10 ) I think people are complaining just for the sake of complaining, they think "Oh it's a good movie, let's insult it to be unique!" when in all actuality they probably enjoyed the movie or just haven't seen it. I just think it's impossible to hate this movie, I mean come on. Jurassic Park. The most popular Dinosaur film ever created, you CAN'T hate it. And Jesus Christ, it's not JUST a horror, it's a thriller, it's a movie catered for kids who love dinosaurs and adults who want a good movie and it delivers on both fronts. So just enough of the bitching. Dizzle (1 out of 10 ) Best movie ever. This transcript isn't even accurate, though. It skips over the two beginning scenes. (Dr. Maldoon Shoot her scene!) & (the Lawyer and Archaeologist scene). Jermaine (10 out of 10 ) Dear Andrew, You're an idiot. Guess what makes a movie a classic: an extremely large amount of people agreeing that it's awesome. I'd love to see you do better. An Awesome Person (7 out of 10 ) Probs the only horror movie I've watched without noticing it's horror! But I loved it, it was a thrill to watch. zshaffer (9 out of 10 ) Turned into a great film, but what I find fascinating, and what no one has mentioned, is that this draft is dated. Shit, it said sometime in '92, and the film came out in '93. This is fascinating because the first three pages are absolutely nothing like what was shot. This must have been one of those movies that was practically scripted by hand on set, something only a genius like Spielberg could do while catering to a mad amount of effects. DGeck (10 out of 10 ) The first "Jurassic Park" is my favorite movie of all time, and I love the sequels and books too! I actually think this script would have been better than the final movie, if only it had Ian Malcolm in it. John Jacob Johnson Smith (9 out of 10 ) Just saw this movie in Imax 3D and it was absolutely beautiful. The experience brought back memories and the recreation was stunning. After watching this again when I am going through Cinema classes, I noticed the wonders of deep and flat space that were used throughout the film. This is a fantastic classic from the 90s and the sequels just don't add up to the first! People who give this a 1 based on the genre know nothing of movies. To me there is no such thing as a genre because all movies are about love, death, or both. The movie is one of my favorites. Everybody did a fantastic job with this film.
