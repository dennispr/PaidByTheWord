"Werechicken"? Is this a script for the godawful cartoon or something? Sure as hell ain't the film script. A.Green (1 out of 10 ) This is the wrong script. This appears to be a transcript for an episode of the CARTOON The Real Ghostbusters. Venkman (1 out of 10 ) I've got a baad feeling about this... Egon (1 out of 10 ) What did you do Ray! Milo (9 out of 10 ) Do, Ray... Egon! shaun (8 out of 10 ) That's a really big twinkie! Richard (4 out of 10 ) Who posted this as a "Ghostbusters" script? That and the fact that this page claims the writers are Aykroyd and Ramis suggest this is a script for the movie. Until one notices the May 1988 script date, hopefully they oughta realize that the original movie was released in 1984 (early June in fact). And when you go in the script itself states it's for an episode of the spinoff cartoon "The Real Ghostbusters". If you look it up, it's a season 4 episode.
