Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely Adapted Screenplay CLOSE ON: A HOUSE-ARREST ANKLE BRACELET. Okay, you see where you're going? Let's work on how to get there. Pan up to find...CLINT BARTON, with his daughter, LILA, coaching her as she notches an arrow in her bow. Okay, good...tip down...bow arm out...three fingers- Why three? `Cause two's not enough and four's too much- You guys want mustard or mayo, or both? CLINT TURNS. IN THE FIELD BEHIND THEM, his wife, LAURA BARTON sets up a picnic as COOPER and NATHANIEL play soccer. Who puts mayo on a hot dog? We'll both have mustard, hon! (to Lila) Okay. Draw back, deep breath... She lets loose. THUD! HER ARROW HITS NEAR THE BULLS-EYE. Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your arrow. Enough murder practice! Soup's on! One sec, babe. Be right there! We're gonna kill some hot dogs. We're hungry. But when he turns back...LILA IS GONE. The bow and arrow lie at his feet. He stares. 2 Lila? Babe, did you see Lila- He turns to his wife, BUT SHE'S GONE. So are the boys. The soccer ball rolls to a stop near the picnic blanket. NO ONE CAN BE SEEN FOR A HUNDRED YARDS IN ALL DIRECTIONS. Guys? Guys, come on... Clint walks toward the field, dread growing. Laura? Clint breaks into a panicked run. CLINT MELTS DOWN, SPINNING AROUND, FRANTIC... TITLE: "TWENTY-TWO DAYS LATER." Soon, THE BENATAR tumbles past, adrift... TONY STARK and NEBULA play table-top football. She wins. (offering his hand) Good sport. Have fun? Nebula studies his hand, confused. Finally she shakes. It was fun. INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT Tony, thin and haggard, kneels in front of HIS BROKEN IRON MAN HELMET. He hits a switch. A light blinks. 3 TONY'S RECORDING: he stares directly into the "camera." This thing on? Hey, Ms. Potts. Pep. If you find this recording, don't post it on social media. It's going to be a real tearjerker. THE BENATAR sparks, adrift. I don't know if you're ever going to see these. I don't even know if you're still...God, I hope so. Today's day twenty-one, no...twenty- two. INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK NEBULA lasers shut Tony's infected wound. You know, if it wasn't for the existential terror of staring into the literal void of space, I'd say I'm feeling a little better today. Infection's run its course, thanks to the Blue Meanie back there. You'd like her. She's very practical. And only a tiny bit sadistic. INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK TONY AND NEBULA MEND THE EMPTY FUEL CELLS UNDER THE FLOOR. The fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge. Bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time. Problem is that was about...49 hours ago. FROM HIGH OVERHEAD, WE WATCH THE BENATAR DRIFT IN SPACE. 4 Which means, we're dead in the water. A thousand light years from the nearest 7-11. INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK Tony hands Nebula the last of A PURPLE POWDER. She pushes it back to him. Most of the quote-unquote `food' and potable water ran out two weeks ago. INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT Tony stands on the flight deck, one hand resting on the glass, staring into the unknown. Pep, I know I said no more surprises. But, I gotta say, I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like...well, you know what it looks like. INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT Back to now. Tony records his thoughts into his helmet. Don't feel bad about this. I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt...I should probably lie down for a minute, rest my eyes. Please know, when I drift off, it will be like every day lately. I'm fine, totally fine. I'm going to dream about you. It's always you. Tony switches the helmet off. NEBULA finds TONY SPRAWLED ON THE FLOOR. 5 Nebula helps Tony into Quill's chair. Tony slumps, completely still. Nebula gives him his privacy. Move in on Tony's face as...A LIGHT SLOWLY GROWS BRIGHTER. Soon, the entire flight deck glows as bright as a sun. Nebula appears from the galley, shading her eyes. Tony's eyelids flutter. Finally, he opens them to see... CAPTAIN MARVEL (CAROL DANVERS) hovering in space. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, BATHROOM - NIGHT STEVE ROGERS shaves. He studies himself in the mirror, exhausted. He's about to tap his razor in the sink's standing water, when... THE WATER RIPPLES. Steve stares a beat, puzzled. Then the lamp catches his eye...SWAYING GENTLY. Just then, a sound roars overhead. Steve turns... EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - NIGHT THE MOON HANGS HUGE OVER THE EARTH. Then the silhouette of THE BENATAR races past, propelled by CAROL DANVERS. Below...STEVE ROGERS, BRUCE BANNER, AND NATASHA ROMANOV watch a flying woman guide the ship to the ground. Behind them, PEPPER POTTS walks up to the group. Steve races up as NEBULA helps Tony down the ramp. I couldn't stop him. Neither could we. I lost the kid. (unable to say it all) We...lost... Is Pepper...? 6 JUST THEN, PEPPER POTTS THROWS HERSELF INTO TONY'S ARMS. Stay here, you stay right here- I'm not going anywhere. NEARBY, NEBULA watches the sad humans. ROCKET SITS BESIDE HER, GRATEFUL. She rests a hand on his furry head. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY RHODEY, TONY, STEVE, NATASHA, AND CAROL watch... A HOLO-DISPLAY ROTATING THROUGH FACES OF PEOPLE WE'VE LOST: WANDA. VISION. BUCKY. T'CHALLA. MARIA HILL. It's been twenty-three days since Thanos came to Earth. TONY, weak, sits in a hi-tech wheelchair, IV dripping into his arm. He stares, taking in the loss: SAM WILSON. SECRETARY ROSS. SHARON CARTER. SCOTT LANG. HOPE VAN DYNE. HANK PYM. NICK FURY. At Fury, Carol bites back emotion. World governments are in pieces, as you can imagine. But the parts that still work are trying to take a census. It looks like he did what he said he was going to do. JANE FOSTER. ERIK SELVIG. WONG. DR. STRANGE. THE BARTON FAMILY. QUILL. DRAX. MANTIS. GROOT. PETER PARKER. Finally, Tony looks away. RHODEY turns it off. Thanos wiped out fifty percent of all the living creatures on Earth. Not just Earth. You sure about that? 7 You never have to ask me that. Where is he now? We don't know. He just opened a portal and walked through. Tony looks out to see...THOR on the patio. What's his deal? He's pissed. Tony turns to see Rocket for the first time. He thinks he failed. Which, of course, he did. But there's a lot of that going around, ain't there? Until this second, I literally thought you were a Build-a-Bear. We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks - deep space scans, satellites - we got nothing. Tony, you fought him- Who told you that? I didn't fight him, he wiped my face with a planet while a Bleecker Street magician gave away the store. There was no fight because he's not beatable. Did he give you anything to go on? Clues, coordinates- Tony stares, lost, barely acknowledging Steve. I saw this coming, few years back. Didn't wanna believe. I thought I was dreaming... 8 Tony, I need you to focus- And I needed you, as in past tense. That trumps what you need. It's too late, buddy. You know what I need? Tony turns to everyone, slightly unstable. I need a shave and a burger, not a bowl of soup. (stands) And I believe I remember telling all of you, alive and otherwise, that we needed a suit of armor around the world, whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not- But that didn't work out, did it? I said we'd lose, you said we'd "do that together, too." Guess what, Cap, we lost, and you weren't there. But that's what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We're the "Avengers", not the "Pre-vengers-" Tony, take it easy... I've got nothing for ya, Cap. No coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero, zip, nada. No trust. (rips out RT) Here. You take this. You find him, you put this on, and hide. (drops to his knees) I'm fine! Tony COLLAPSES. Rhodey catches him. 9 INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CORRIDOR - DAY CAROL, STEVE, AND NATASHA stare through GLASS DOORS at TONY IN A HOSPITAL BED, PEPPER AND BANNER AT HIS SIDE. RHODEY STEPS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL ROOM. Bruce gave him a sedative. Should be out the rest of the day. (heading for the lab) Take care of him. When I come back, I'll bring a bottle of Xorrian elixir. Where are you going? To kill Thanos. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY NATASHA catches up to CAROL IN THE WORKSHOP. Hey, hey, hang on. We're sort of a team here. Between you and me, morale's a little fragile. Oh, I'm sorry. My fault. Carol sees Steve and Rhodey catch up. She claps her hands. All right, team! I'm going to go kill Thanos. Message me if you get any intel that can help. Otherwise, I'll report back when he's dead. Great work, everybody. Look, we realize "up there's" more your territory, but this is our fight, too. Do you even know where he is? 10 I know people who might- Don't bother. They all turn to see NEBULA in THE LIVING AREA DOORWAY. I can tell you where Thanos is. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA - DAY STEVE, NATASHA, RHODEY, BANNER, ROCKET, THOR, and CAROL gather. NEBULA studies her robotic hand. Thanos spent a long time trying to...perfect me. When he worked, he talked. About his Great Plan. Even disassembled, I wanted to please him. I'd ask, where would we go once his plan was complete? His answer was always the same: "To the Garden." You're saying Thanos had a retirement plan. Where's this garden? ROCKET brings up EARTH on A HOLO-MAP. A BRIGHT SURGE OF ENERGY ENVELOPS THE PLANET (EMANATING FROM WAKANDA). When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth become ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. No one's seen anything like it. He shifts the map, crossing billions of light years, to...AN IDENTICAL SURGE ENVELOPING A MYSTERIOUS, ORANGE PLANET. Until two days ago. You're saying he snapped his fingers again. Where? 11 Rocket zooms the holo-image toward a cluster of stars... Planet is unnamed, but inhabitable. Rich atmosphere, good soil- A garden. Thanos is there. And he just used the stones. Steve eyes everyone. THOR FINALLY LOOKS UP. (thinking of himself) You know, we'd be going short- handed. Because he killed all our friends. Are we saying they're dead? We're using that word now? He's still got the stones. So, we take them. And we use them to bring everybody back. Just like that? Yeah. Just like that. No one speaks. Finally... If there's even the smallest chance we can undo this, then we owe it to everyone who's not sitting here to try. Everyone looks around the room...AGREED. If we do this...why would it end any differently than it did before? 12 Because before you didn't have me. Hey, new girl. All of us in here are about that superhero life. Where've you been all this time? There's a lot of people in the universe. And they didn't all have you. THOR STANDS. He crosses to Carol and holds out his hand. STORMBREAKER WHIPS PAST HER HEAD, RUFFLING HER HAIR. Carol doesn't flinch. Thor smiles. I like this one. Steve stares at the planet a long, deciding moment. Then... Let's go get that son of a bitch. INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - DAWN EVERYONE settles into their seats on the Benatar's flight deck. STEVE WATCHES EARTH GROW SMALLER THROUGH THE WINDOW. Trust me. You get used to it. ROCKET looks around from the pilot's chair. Okay, who here hasn't been to space? STEVE, NATASHA, and RHODEY half-raise their hands. Oh, you're gonna hate this. Approaching jump in three, two... STEVE'S FINGERS TIGHTEN on the arm rest as... 13 WHOOSH! THE BENATAR WARPS, LEAPING INTO JUMP SPACE. WHOOSH! THE BENATAR ARRIVES ABOVE AN OMINOUS, ORANGE PLANET. As the ship maintains orbit, CAROL flies toward the planet. I'll head down for recon. If I'm not back in fifteen, you'll know I found him. INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - SPACE OUR HEROES wait on the flight deck, tense. NATASHA looks at STEVE, who's staring at...A COMPASS: PEGGY CARTER'S YELLOWED PHOTO STILL RESTS INSIDE. This is going to work, Steve. I know it will. (beat) Because I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't. JUST THEN, CAROL FLIES UP TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS. No satellites, no ships, no armies. No ground defenses of any kind. It's just him. That's enough. The Avengers exchange a look. SMOKE CURLS FROM THE CHIMNEY OF A SOLITARY LODGE. A POT BOILS OVER A FIRE. Then...THANOS LIMPS TOWARD IT, LEFT SIDE PARALYZED, arm blackened. A shell of his former self. 14 He stirs the pot. Suddenly, AN ARMORED HAND BURSTS FROM THE FIRE, GRABBING THANOS' GAUNTLET... PREVENTING THANOS FROM CLOSING HIS FIST. Thanos jerks back as HULKBUSTER SPRINGS INSIDE. CAROL AND RHODEY BASH THROUGH THE ROOF, PINNING THANOS' ARMS. THOR crashes through the door, followed by the others. HE SWINGS STORMBREAKER...CUTTING OFF THANOS' HAND. The Gauntlet lands at Rocket's feet. He picks it up...and his face goes slack. He turns the glove toward the others. And we now realize...THE INFINITY STONES ARE GONE. Where are they? Thanos doesn't answer. CAROL PRESSES HIM TO HIS KNEES. Answer the question! The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose beyond temptation. You murdered trillions. You should be grateful. Where are the stones? Gone. Reduced to atoms. You used them two days ago! I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be. That lands, sickening. ROCKET SEARCHES, FRANTIC, NEAR TEARS. No...they can't be gone... 15 He's lying. My father is many things. A liar is not one of them. Thank you, daughter. Perhaps I've treated you- SWOOSH. THOR'S AXE SEVERS THANOS' HEAD FROM HIS BODY. IT HITS THE FLOOR, FOLLOWED BY THE THUD OF HIS HUGE FRAME. What did you do? Thor just stares, his long journey a failure. I went for the head. As Thor walks away, Steve looks at Thanos' head on the ground. IT'S OVER. THEY LOST. OVER BLACK: "FIVE YEARS LATER." A CAR CRUSHER flattens an Audi. THOUSANDS MORE NEVER-DRIVEN CARS LIE STACKED ON THE DOCKS, WAITING THEIR TURN. A HUGE TARP flaps over the shuttered LINCOLN CENTER. A TEENAGE GIRL rides her skateboard, alone in a weed-filled parking lot. Pull back to see THE EMPTY STADIUM BEHIND HER. INT. BROOKLYN COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT A POSTER SHOWS A SINGLE FIGURE STARING AT A GROUP OF SHADOWS. IT READS, "WHERE DO WE GO, NOW THAT THEY'RE GONE?" The bottom reads, "BROOKLYN SUPPORT GROUP, TUESDAYS 8PM." 16 A GRIEVING MAN speaks in A RECOVERY GROUP. So, I went on a date the other day. Good job, Bobby. Back in the game. Thank you, Jimmy. (to the group) First in five years. I sat there at dinner thinking, what are we even supposed to talk about? STEVE ROGERS, thinner, older, LISTENS INTENTLY. What did you talk about? Same old crap. How much things have changed. How much we miss the Mets. My job, his job. Then it got kind of quiet. He cried during the salads. What about you? I cried just before dessert. But I'm seeing him again tomorrow. So... That's great. You've already done the hardest part. You took a jump, didn't know where you'd come down. And that's it, those little brave baby steps we've gotta take. To try to make us feel whole again, to find a purpose... (to everyone) I went into the ice right after I met the love of my life. Woke up seventy years later and...had to keep going. The group takes this in. 17 The world's been left in our hands. If we don't do something with it...then Thanos might as well have killed all of us. People nod, but Steve seems unconvinced by his own words. THE CAMERA ROTATES down from the sky onto a strangely quiet San Francisco, until it finds...A STORAGE WAREHOUSE. INT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE, UNIT 277 - DAY LUIS' VAN sits in a storage unit, surrounded by boxes: "S. LANG, KITCHEN, S. LANG, CLOTHES." THROUGH THE VAN WINDOWS, we see...HANK PYM'S QUANTUM TUNNEL. A MEANDERING RAT CRAWLS ONTO THE CONTROLS. IT ACCIDENTALLY STEPS ON A TOGGLE SWITCH and...A LIGHT GOES GREEN. FLASH. THE BACK DOORS OF THE VAN BLOW OPEN, revealing...SCOTT LANG, ANT-MAN suit shorting. He retracts his helmet, gasping. INT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE, SECURITY OFFICE - DAY A GUARD reads THE TERMINAL BEACH, by J.G. Ballard. He looks up at a monitor: SCOTT LANG holds up a sign, "HELP." A dented WAGON rolls over a speed-bump. Scott, in his old clothes, slowly wheels his belongings away. The Guard watches him go, puzzled. EXT. SAN FRANCISCO, STREET - DAY Scott walks A STREET OF ABANDONED HOMES. Hello? He hears A CLACKING. A KID on a bicycle rides by, playing card wedged between his spokes. Scott waves him down. The kid stops. 18 Hey. Kid. What happened here? The kid says nothing. He just stares at Scott with a haunted look. Then he stands on his pedal and keeps riding. CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK... EXT. SAN FRANCISCO, GOLDEN GATE PARK - DAY STONE MONUMENTS loom in a park. A small crowd mills. Reveal Scott looking over the monuments, lost. Scott walks up to the obelisks. At the top, they read: "THE VANISHED." Hundreds of names line the stones. He scans the "L's," finally finding, "SCOTT LANG." What? (realizing) Cassie... EXT. MAGGIE LANG'S HOUSE - DAY A winded Scott races up the sidewalk toward his old house. He leaps a bush, banging on the front door. Cassie! Cassie! SOON, A TEEN GIRL opens the door, shocked. A very long beat. Dad? Peanut? Scott wraps his arms around CASSIE LANG (14), now five years older than when he last saw her. She hugs him, CRYING. I thought you were gone. I'm sorry. I'm back...I'm back...I'm back... 19 EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, FRONT GATE - DAWN Avengers Compound stands amidst overgrown grass. Rusty chains lock the gate. Faded signs warn: "RESTRICTED AREA. KEEP OUT." INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA - NIGHT NATASHA SITS SURROUNDED BY HOLO-SCREENS FEATURING CAROL DANVERS, RHODEY, ROCKET AND NEBULA, AND OKOYE. We boarded that "highly suspect warship" Danvers pinged. And? It was an infectious garbage scow. So thanks for the hot tip- You were closer. And now we smell like garbage- (to Okoye) You get a reading on those tremors? Minor subduction in the African plate. Do we have a visual? How are you handling it? Nat. It was a mild earthquake. In the ocean. We handle it by not handling it. Natasha looks burdened. Rhodey steps in. 20 I can have NASA redirect a satellite, do a sweep just to make sure. Thanks. Carol, you're still coming our way next month? Not likely. Getting another haircut? Listen, fur-face, I'm covering a lot of territory out here. The things that have been happening on Earth have been happening everywhere else. On thousands of planets. You might not see me for a long time. All right. Everybody keep keeping their eyes open. This channel's always active. Anything goes sideways, anyone makes trouble where they shouldn't, it comes through me. They ad lib their goodbyes as they sign off, except Rhodey. What's up? Where are you? Mexico. Got some news. Okay... Federal�s found a room full of bodies outside Juarez. Cartel guys. Guns still in their pants. Could be a rival hit- But it wasn't. Same MO as Marseille. And Kiev. 21 (beat) It's definitely Barton. She nods, grim, reluctantly accepting. What he's done here...what he's been doing...I got to tell you, part of me doesn't want to find him. Natasha just stares a long beat. Find out where's he going next. Rhodey nods, signing off. Natasha sits there, THEN CRUMPLES. After a long beat... I'd offer to cook you dinner but you seem sad enough already. Natasha turns to see STEVE in the doorway. Come by to do your laundry? And see a friend. Your friend's fine. She leave the house today? Nothing out there I particularly want to see. I spotted a pod of whales coming over the bridge. (dubious) In the Hudson. Fewer ships, cleaner water. Just saying, there's still a world out there. 22 If you're about to tell me to look on the bright side, I'm about to hit you with a peanut butter sandwich. Steve relents, LETTING DOWN HIS FACADE. Sorry. Force of habit. I don't know how you do it. Steve bites into the uneaten half of her sandwich. I guess I don't know how not to. Me, neither. After a long moment, Steve looks up at her, honest. I keep telling them, move on. Grow past it. And some of them actually do. But not us. If I move on, who does this? Maybe it doesn't need to be done. Natasha takes that in. Steve is thinking of giving up. She looks around at Avengers Compound. I used to have nothing. Then I got this. This job, this family. And I was better because of it. She chokes slightly, collecting herself. And even though they're gone, I'm still trying to be...better. I think we both need to get a life. You first. 23 They stare at each other a long, melancholy moment. THEN, WE HEAR A PING. NATASHA SWIPES TO A CCTV DISPLAY: SCOTT LANG'S FACE FILLS A SCREEN, LUIS' VAN BEHIND HIM. Hello? Is anyone home? This is, uh, Scott Lang? We met a few years ago. At the airport? This an old message? (stunned) It's the front gate. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - NIGHT SCOTT paces, mumbling to himself. Scott, are you okay? What? Yes. He turns to STEVE and NATASHA. Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics? Only to make conversation. Steve glances at her. She shrugs. Well, five years ago, just before this Thanos guy...I went into a place called the Quantum Realm. It's like its own microscopic universe. You can only get there if you're incredibly small. Hope, she's my...she was supposed to pull me out. But then Thanos happened. And I was stuck in there. I'm sorry. It must've been a long five years. 24 (getting excited) Okay, but that's the thing. It wasn't. For me, it was only five hours. The rules in the Quantum Realm aren't like out here. They're completely unpredictable. Is anybody gonna eat that sandwich? Scott, what are you talking about? Time works differently in the Quantum Realm. Steve and Natasha share a look. Problem is, right now, it's chaos, there's no way to navigate it. But what if we could figure out a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time...and come out in another. Like, before Thanos- Wait...wait. Scott. Are you talking about a time machine? No, not a machine. More like a... (searches, then gives up) Yeah, like a time machine. I know it sounds crazy... Scott, I get emails from a raccoon. Nothing's crazy anymore. So, who do we talk to about this? EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY LLAMAS and FARM ANIMALS GRAZE A RUSTIC-TECH ECO-COMPOUND. EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, WOODS - DAY TONY approaches A WOODED GLADE near the house. 25 Morgan H. Stark. Chow time. Want some lunch? Silence. Then MORGAN STARK (4) steps out of her play tent, wearing A PURPLE-BLUE IRON MAN HELMET (RESCUE). Define lunch or be disintegrated. You should not be wearing that. It's part of a special anniversary gift I made for Mom. You thinking about lunch? Tony gently takes the helmet off, revealing A YOUNG GIRL. Where'd you find this? Garage. Tony picks her up, walking toward the house. You like going in the garage? So does Daddy. It's all right. Mommy never wears what I buy her. Tony and Morgan exit the woods. Suddenly, Tony stops. In the driveway, STEVE ROGERS stares at him. NATASHA AND SCOTT GET OUT OF THE CAR BEHIND HIM. EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, PORCH - DAY STEVE, SCOTT, and NATASHA sit with TONY. I just want to thank you folks for dropping by. It's not every day one gets to contemplate biting it on an inter-dimensional timescape. You've got some objections to the plan. 26 So you're calling it a plan. To me, it sounds like an exotic suicide method. Not to mention, it's impossible. We know what it sounds like. Tony, after what you've seen, is anything really impossible? Quantum fluctuation kinda messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition, can we agree on that? (offering more tea) Chai? (back on message) In layman's terms, it means you can cancel your Netflix subscription because you're not coming home. I did. Which was a billion-to-one cosmic fluke. Now you want to pull a- What are you calling it? A time heist. Oh, of course, a time heist, why didn't we think of this before? Right, because it's a pipe dream. Who are you again? Still Scott... Tony, the Stones exist in the past. We could get them and bring them here. We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everybody back. 27 Or screw it up worse than he already has. I don't believe we would. Tony stares at Steve, a lot of water under the bridge. Gotta say it. Sometimes I've missed that giddy optimism. Sadly, all your high hopes won't help me if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said "time heist." I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise. Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. No talking to our past selves. No betting on sporting events- Stop, Scott. Stop. Are you telling me that your plan to save the universe is more than loosely based on Back to the Future? (meaning "yes") No... Good. Because that would be horseshit. Scientifically speaking, your brother's picture doesn't disappear just `cause you went to the dance with your mom. That's not how quantum physics works. We have to take a stand. We did stand. And yet here we are. Look, Stark- Can I call you Tony? 28 Please don't- Tony- Fine. I get that you've got a lot on the line, here. You've got a wife. A daughter. But I lost someone very important - a lot of us did - and now we have a chance to save her, and everyone else, and you won't even- No, Scott. I won't. Even. Suddenly, MORGAN walks onto the porch. Mommy told me to come save you. Tony takes Morgan into his arms and heads inside. Good job. I'm saved. (to Steve) I wish you were coming here to ask me something else. I'm honestly happy to see you. If you want to stay- Steve tries one last time. Tony, I get it. And I'm happy for you. I am. But this is a second chance. Yeah, well, I got my second chance right here. I can't roll the dice on it. The table is set for six. If you don't talk shop, you're welcome to stay for lunch. He exits. 29 EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND - DAY Steve, Natasha, and Scott walk toward the car. He's scared. He's not wrong. What are we gonna do? We need him. You want to stop? No. I want to do it right. (beat) We're going to need a really big brain. Bigger than his? ONLOOKERS crowd a diner window, trying to peek inside. I'm confused. SMART HULK ROLLS UP A PIZZA AND EATS IT LIKE A BURRITO. SCOTT, STEVE, AND NATASHA SIT ACROSS FROM HIM. These are confusing times. No, that's not what I'm- I'm kidding, I get it. It's crazy. I wear shirts now! But --- why? Five years ago, we got our asses kicked, right? 30 Smart Hulk eats a stack of pancakes in two bites. He's heard. It was worse for me. Because I lost twice. First Hulk lost. Then Banner lost. Then we all lost. No one blamed you, Bruce. I did- I feel like I'm the only one eating. Here, try some. He holds out a pizza. They decline. He shrugs. Thing is, I kept thinking, it didn't have to be that way. That the best of Banner and best of Hulk, if they'd worked together, maybe they could've stopped Thanos. Okay. But how did...this happen? For years I treated the Hulk like a disease, something to get rid of. But when I started treating him like the cure... Smart Hulk MESHES HIS FINGERS together. Eighteen months in the Gamma Lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Best of both worlds. TWO KIDS amble up to the booth. Mr. Hulk? Can we get a picture? 100%, little lady. The kid hands a phone to Steve. SMART HULK makes a duck face as Steve sheepishly snaps the pic, handing the phone back. 31 (to the fan) Thanks, pal. Hulk out! So, Bruce, about what we said- The time travel do-over? I don't know, that's kind of outside my field of expertise... Natasha nods at his Smart Hulk-ness, history between them. You pulled this off. I remember a time that was impossible, too. He considers, then finally relents, pulling out his phone. I'm supposed to be on Oprah next week, but I guess I could move things around. INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, KITCHEN - NIGHT TONY STARK DOES DISHES. He rinses with the sprayer. It goes everywhere. He wipes down the counter, including... A PICTURE OF PETER PARKER. He stares. INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, SIDE PORCH - NIGHT Tony builds HOLO MODELS: Penrose diagrams, wormholes. He studies a STAR-SHAPED CAPACITOR, intrigued. Friday, you up? Yes, sir. I've had a mild inspiration, like to see if it checks out. I would like to run one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a Mobius Strip, inverted. 32 Processing. The model forms. All right, give me the eigenvalue of that particle, factoring in spectral decomp. Run it. That'll take a second. And don't worry if it doesn't pan out, I'm just kind of... THE CAPACITOR GLOWS. A HOLO-MAN DRIFTS INTO A CIRCULAR WORMHOLE, LOOPING...RETURNING TO THE PLACE IT FIRST LEFT. Model rendered. (in awe) Shit. Shit. Tony turns to see HIS DAUGHTER in the doorway. What are you doing up? Shit. First of all, that's a Mommy word, she coined it. Why are you up? I just had something on my mind. Was it juice pops? Correct. Great minds think alike. What kind do you want? 33 INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, MORGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT Morgan eats A JUICE POP in bed. Tony watches. You done? (finishing her popsicle) Now you are. Tell me a story. Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end. That was a bad story. He runs his hand over her hair. Love you tons. Love you three thousand. Wow, that's a lot. Tony turns out the light, exits. INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT PHOTOS crowd a side table: Pepper, Morgan, Tony. Even one of HOWARD STARK, PEGGY CARTER & HANK PYM UNDER A SHIELD SYMBOL. Find...PEPPER, curled up on the couch reading. Then... Out like a light. Don't know how much she loves you but she loves me three thousand. That's up there. What're you reading? A book about composting- 34 I think I solved it. Pepper looks up. Just so we're both talking about the same thing- Time travel. That's amazing. Yeah. And terrifying. To say the least. He sits beside her. She stares, SHARING IN HIS DILEMMA. We got really lucky- I know- Not everybody did. I can't help everybody. Except, it sort of seems like you can. Not if I stopped right here. Tony, trying to get you to stop is one of the few failures of my life. I could just lock the lab, put it in a trunk, sink it to the bottom of the lake, and go to bed. 35 But could you rest? INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY SCOTT WAITS IN HIS ANT-MAN 2 QUANTUM SUIT IN FRONT OF THE You're sure these modifications are safe? He looks over to...SMART HULK, WEARING READING GLASSES, MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO A NEW CONTROL PANEL. I reran my calculations three times- Because the guy who invented this thing is pretty much a genius- I have seven PhD's, an MD, the Hans Bethe Award for Physics, and I'm personal friends with Bill Nye the Science Guy. We're good. Yeah. And you look like that on purpose. STEVE and NATASHA enter from outside. Breakers are set, emergency generator's on stand-by. Good. If we blow the grid, I don't want to lose Tiny back in the `50's. Excuse me? He was kidding. I was kidding. 36 (to Hulk) You were kidding, right? Honestly, I have no idea. We're attempting time travel. Either it's all a joke, or none of it is. (loudly to Scott) We're good! Helmet on. Scott puts on his helmet, slightly dubious. Okay. I'm going to send you back one week, give you an hour to look around, then bring you back in ten seconds. Make sense? Perfectly not confusing. Good luck, Scott. You've got this. (inspired) Yes, I do, Captain America. Yes, I- SMART HULK PULLS A LEVER. SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING. Counting down from three, two, one... SUDDENLY SCOTT REAPPEARS...BUT HE'S 12-YEARS-OLD. Uh, guys? This doesn't feel right. Is that Scott? Probably...? He scrambles, hitting buttons. SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING. Get him back! Smart Hulk flips a switch. SCOTT REAPPEARS...AT AGE 93. 37 Oh, my back! Bruce! Get it under control. What the hell is going on? I got it, I know exactly what's going on. Pretty much. SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING AGAIN. HULK TYPES FRANTICALLY with A PENCIL, fingers too big for the keys. Oh, my God. It's a baby. It's Scott. As a baby! Smart Hulk hits a button. Baby Scott disappears. When I tell you, kill the power! (throwing a switch) Now! NATASHA KILLS THE POWER. Normal Scott stumbles off the pad. Somebody peed my pants. I don't know if it was baby-me or old-me. Or just me-me. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY Steve leans on the wall, discouraged. Then he hears AN ENGINE ROAR. AN AUDI races up the drive. It stops, the window rolling down to reveal...TONY. Why the long face? Wild guess, he turned into a baby? 38 Among other things. (getting out of the car) EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you were pushing time through Lang. It's dangerous. I probably should've cautioned you against it. You did. Thank god, I'm here. Regardless, I fixed it. He holds up...HIS STAR-SHAPED CAPACITOR. That is a fully-functioning, time- space GPS. I just want peace. Resentment is corrosive. I hate it. Me, too. Something eases between them, for the first time in years. We've got a shot at the Stones. I just need you to know my priorities. Bring back everyone we lost, hopefully. Keep what I found, definitely. And, let's not die trying. Steve looks at Tony. Finally, he offers his hand. Sounds like a deal. They shake. This is a long time coming. Finally... But wait, there's more. Act now, and it comes with a bonus offer. Tony pops the trunk. Steve stares, moved, at...HIS SHIELD. Tony, I don't know- 39 What's to know? He made it for you. Plus, I gotta get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding. Steve finally picks up the shield, SLIDING IT ONTO HIS ARM. Thank you, Tony. Tony chokes up, then covers by slamming the trunk. Just don't flaunt it. I didn't bring enough for the whole team. We are getting the whole team, right? We're trying. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY SCOTT sits on a bench, eating a hardshell taco. THEN A MASSIVE EXHAUST WIND BLASTS HIM, blowing his taco away. THE BENATAR lands outside AVENGERS COMPOUND. NEBULA AND ROCKET EMERGE. Rocket waits at the end of the gangway. Hey, Humie. Where's Big Green? Um, kitchen, I think. Scott tries a smile at Nebula. She just hits her COM: Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There's an idiot in the landing zone. She goes in. THEN, WHAM, WAR MACHINE LANDS, STARTLING SCOTT. Oh, my God! What's up, Regular-Sized Man? Rhodey goes inside as SMART HULK walks out, carrying an overnight bag. He hands Scott some tacos. 40 Finally. I ain't got all day. I call shotgun! As he walks up the Benatar's gangway, PRE-LAP A METALLIC The scraping goes on as we see...A NORWEGIAN FISHING VILLAGE. Tilt to a sign: "NEW ASGARD," in English and ASGARDIAN RUNES. A PICK-UP passes, scraping the pavement: SMART HULK AND ROCKET SIT IN BACK, WEIGHING DOWN THE TRUCK. EXT. NEW ASGARD, VILLAGE - DAY SMART HULK AND ROCKET WALK THROUGH TOWN. ASGARDIANS IN EARTHLY CLOTHES EYE THEM WITH SUSPICION. What the heck are they looking at? I'm kind of famous... Yeah, I'm sure that's it. Kind of a step down from golden palaces and magic hammers... They lost Asgard, then half their people. Maybe they're just happy to have a home. You shouldn't have come. VALKYRIE approaches from the pier. Smart Hulk GRINS. Hey, Valkyrie! Great to see you! He goes for a hug...VAL DOESN'T. She studies the new him. Uh huh. I liked you better either of the other ways. 41 This is Rocket. Hey. Hey. (to both) He won't see you. We didn't say we were here to see- Great, then you can hose out the gut buckets- We're definitely here to see him. He can't give you what you need. It's that bad? We only see him once a month. When he comes in for "supplies." She nods to A DOZEN BEER KEGS STACKED OUTSIDE A PUB. Smart Hulk and Rocket knock on the door of A CABIN. Nothing. SMART HULK opens the door. PIZZA BOXES and LIQUOR BOTTLES litter the floor. Rocket recoils. Something died in here. Hello...? Thor...? Are you here about the cable? We hear a HEAVY SHUFFLING as someone approaches. 42 Cinemax went out two days ago, and the sports are all...fuzzy... THOR enters, CONFUSED, A LITTLE DRUNK, SHIRTLESS...AND TREMENDOUSLY FAT. Rocket and Hulk stare. Thor? BROS! Bring it in! Thor hugs Smart Hulk. He turns to Rocket, who steps back. Yeah, I'm good. Hulk, you know my boys, Korg and Miek, right? KORG and MIEK sit on the couch, playing Playstation 4. Beer's in the bucket. Feel free to log on to the WiFi. Hey, guys. Long time no- Thor! This kid on the TV just called me a dickhead! Noobmaster again? NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead- Thor snatches KORG'S HEADSET and hisses into the mic. Noobmaster, this is Thor, again. God of Thunder. This is your last warning. Log off this game or I will come to your basement, rip off your arms and shove them up your butt. (handing the headset back) Right, who wants a drink? 43 SMART HULK AND ROCKET JUST STARE. Thor pulls a beer from the fridge, and whacks the cap against STORMBREAKER. Hey, buddy, are you all right? Don't I look all right? (under his breath) You look like melted ice cream- So, what's up? Just here for a hang? We need your help. There's a chance we can fix everything. Like the cable? It's driving me bananas. Like Thanos. THOR GRABS HULK'S SHIRT, INTENSE. KORG RISES FROM THE COUCH. Don't say that name. Yeah, we don't say that name in here. Smart Hulk looks down at THOR'S HAND STILL ON HIS SHIRT. Please take your hand off me. Thor looks into Hulk's eyes...and gently removes his hand. Now, I know the thought of...that guy might scare you- Scared? Why would I be scared of that guy? I'm the one who killed that guy, remember? (looking around) Anyone else here kill that guy? 44 Didn't think so. Korg, tell everyone who chopped Thanos' head off. Stormbreaker? Thor uncaps a whiskey bottle. BLAM, IT SHATTERS IN HIS HAND. Reveal...ROCKET, BLASTER SMOKING. Not. Cool. Man. Don't. Care. Dude. Look, I get it. You're in a rough patch. I've been there. But you know who helped me out of it? Was it Natasha? It was you. You helped me. And I need you to help me again. Ask the Asgardians down there how much "my help" is worth. At least they're alive- They were gods! Now they're fisherpeople! (sagging into a chair) The ones that are left, anyway. That's the thing. I think we can bring them back. Thor's tempted, but shakes his head. Stop. Stop. I know you think I'm down here, wallowing in my own self- pity, waiting to be rescued. But I'm fine. I'm happy. Whatever it is you're offering, don't care. Couldn't care less. 45 Hulk and Rocket stare at Thor. Come on, pal. We need you. He still can't meet their gaze. Finally... There's beer in the ship. (beat) What kind? A KARAOKE BAR LIES IN RUINS AS A TINNY POP SONG PLAYS. BLOOD POOLS BENEATH DEAD YAKUZA THUGS, UZIS JUST OUT OF REACH AS WE PULL BACK...THE MUSIC FADES, REPLACED BY A SOFT CRYING. A TERRIFIED HOSTESS DARTS FROM COVER, WIPING AWAY THE CHYRON. KEEP PULLING BACK...PAST A CAR SMASHED THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW, TATTOOED DRIVER SLUMPED OVER THE WHEEL, GUN IN HAND. WE HEAR RAIN, A REVVING ENGINE, AND THEN GUNFIRE. PULL ONTO THE SIDEWALK, TURNING JUST AS A MOTORCYCLE CRASHES, RIDER TUMBLING PAST US IN A WHITE MOHAWKED HELMET. ANOTHER MOTORCYCLE RACES TOWARD US, BUT... WHFT-WHFT, TWO ARROWS SEND THE RIDER SKIDDING INTO A WALL, TIRES SQUEALING AS THE BIKE SPINS HELPLESSLY ON ITS SIDE. CAMERA TURNS TOWARD AN ALCOVE, WHERE A YAKUZA THUG TUMBLES A MASKED FIGURE HEADS UP, STOPPING MOMENTARILY TO DRAW HIS BEHIND THE SMOKED GLASS OF SECOND FLOOR WINDOWS, THE FIGURE CRASH, THE THUG COMES SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW. THUD. WHIP THROUGH THE RAIN TO THE UPPER FLOORS OF THE BUILDING. GUNFIRE FLASHES AS THE FIGHT CONTINUES PAST THREE WINDOWS... 46 SUDDENLY, THE FOURTH WINDOW SHATTERS AS A YAKUZA BOSS, AKIHIKO, LEAPS OVER THE SIDEWALK... LANDING ON THE METAL AWNING OF A NOODLE SHOP. HE ROLLS TO THE WET STREET, LANDING HARD ON HIS ANKLE. THE MYSTERIOUS FIGURE GRACEFULLY LEAPS AFTER HIM, BOUNCING OFF THE AWNING AND DROPPING TO THE STREET BELOW. RACK UP TO GET OUR BEST LOOK YET AT...RONIN. HARD-SET EYES STARE AT AKIHIKO THROUGH A BLACK MASK. THEY BATTLE. (Japanese, subtitled) Why are you doing this? We never did anything to you! (Japanese, subtitled) You survived. Half the planet didn't. They got Thanos. You get me. Akihiko attacks. Ronin slashes him across the middle. (Japanese, subtitled) You're done hurting people. Akihiko gestures at the bodies in the street. We hurt people? You're crazy. -- Ronin slashes Akihiko's throat. The man drops to his knees. Wait! Help me! I'll give you anything! What do you want? What I want...you can't give me. Ronin finishes him off. AKIHIKO GOES STILL. SIRENS WAIL. Ronin removes his mask, revealing... CLINT BARTON, haggard. He hears A FOOTFALL. He whirls, katana raised...then stops. His face goes slack as... NATASHA STEPS INTO A POOL OF LIGHT, A LARGE BLACK UMBRELLA They stare at each other. Clint hasn't seen her in years. She hasn't seen what he's become. 47 You shouldn't be here. Neither should you. I've got a job to do. That what you're calling this? She moves even closer. He stiffens. Killing these people isn't going to bring your family back. (beat) We found something. A chance, maybe... Don't. Don't what? Give me hope. I'm just sorry I couldn't give it sooner. CLINT DISSOLVES, sagging into her arms. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY THOR STANDS WITH A BEER IN A COZY, staring at A NEW QUANTUM TUNNEL (2.0), AFFIXED WITH TONY'S CAPACITOR. Out of the way, Lebowski. Thor shuffles aside as Tony blows past. Hey, Ratchet, you get lost in there? It's Rocket, and shut up. You're only a genius on Earth, pal. 48 And you're only in there because you have tiny hands. ROCKET, COVERED IN GREASE, WRIGGLES OUT A HATCH. Fixed it. Thank you. Get used to saying that. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY SMART HULK fits SCOTT with A BRAND NEW TIME SUIT. NEBULA ASSISTS. RHODEY enters the workshop, eyeing the suit. Time travel suit, I like it. SMART HULK awkwardly tries to fit a pair of RED TEST TUBES Easy, easy. Careful with those. I'm being very careful- You're being very Hulky- Scott takes the tubes from him and inserts them, himself. These are Pym Particles. You can't shrink to the Quantum Realm without them, and since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, we can't make any more. I told you. We've only got enough for one round trip each, no do-overs. Scott gently clicks the tubes into their housing. Plus two test runs- SUDDENLY, SCOTT SHRINKS INTO NOTHING, THEN GROWS BACK. He takes that in... 49 One test run. (embarrassed) Okay, maybe I'm not ready. I'm game. They turn to see CLINT leaning in the doorway. I'll do it. NOW, CLINT WEARS THE TIME SUIT. Scott looks on, sulky. SMART HULK, RHODEY, and NEBULA attach the Pym housing. Okay, Clint, you might feel a little disoriented when you chronoshift- Hang on, I've got to ask, if we can do this, why don't we just go find baby Thanos and, you know... Rhodey makes a STRANGLING GESTURE. Uh, one, because that's horrible. And, two, killing baby Thanos doesn't kill adult Thanos. Time doesn't work like that. You can't change the future by changing the past. Sure, we can. We take the stones before Thanos gets them, then he doesn't have them. Problem solved. That's not how it works. I don't know. That is kind of what I've heard- Heard from who? 50 Star Trek. Terminator. Bill and Ted's Excellent- WHY DOES EVERYONE THINK THIS? THAT'S NOT TRUE. IF YOU TRAVEL TO THE PAST, THEN THAT PAST HAS BECOME YOUR PRESENT, AND YOUR FORMER PRESENT HAS BECOME THE PAST, WHICH NOW CAN'T BE CHANGED BY YOUR NEW Exactly. Excuse me? Scott leans over, whispering: Apparently, Back to the Future is bullshit. Look, are we doing this or not? INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY CLINT WAITS ALONE ON THE PLATFORM, WEARING THE TIME SUIT. SMART HULK readies THE QUANTUM CONSOLE as ROCKET, RHODEY, NEBULA, THOR, and STEVE look on. Okay, Clint. Starting in three, two, one... Clint nods over at them, determined. SUDDENLY, HE STRETCHES, SHRINKS, AND VANISHES. WHOOSH. Through the slats of a barn, we see a tractor. ENERGY FLARES, REVEALING CLINT BARTON IN A TIME SUIT. He walks to the open door, staring at...HIS OLD HOME. 51 EXT./INT. BARTON HOME, FRONT PORCH - DAY Clint climbs the porch. He accidentally kicks...A BASEBALL MITT. Then he hears VOICES. He stares into the house through THE SCREEN DOOR. From the sounds of it, LAURA and THE KIDS are making dinner. HIS DAUGHTER LAUGHS. Clint's face crumples. Just then...HIS QUANTUM CUFF VIBRATES. A SCREEN COUNTS DOWN: 0:03. No. Not yet... (opening the door) BUT HIS BODY STARTS TO GLOW. 0.01- CLINT VANISHES. THE SCREEN DOOR SLAMS. After a moment, LILA runs in. Dad? INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY CLINT APPEARS ON THE PAD, SHAKEN. TONY and NATASHA approach. Are you all right? Hey, look at me. You okay? Tell me something good... Clint looks up, tearful. He holds out THE BASEBALL MITT. It worked. It worked. Reveal Steve, Smart Hulk, Nebula, Rhodey, Scott, Thor, and Rocket, looking on. Holy crap. We're freaking time travelers. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 1 - DAY (MOCO) On a HOLO-BOARD: "MIND, SPACE, TIME, POWER, REALITY, SOUL." Above each word hovers...ITS ARTIFACT: LOKI'S SCEPTER, THE TESSERACT, THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO, THE ORB, THE AETHER CONTAINER, AND A QUESTION MARK. 52 Okay. Now that we've got how, we're going to need where and when. NEBULA, TONY, RHODEY, SCOTT, SMART HULK, ROCKET, NATASHA, and CLINT look on. Most folks here have encountered at least one of the six Infinity Stones- I think you mean nearly been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones. I haven't. (off their looks) Just...saying. Regardless, we've only got enough Pym Particles for one round trip, each. And the Stones have been in a lot of places throughout history. Our history. Not all of them are going to be a fun drop-in. Which means we've got to pick our targets. Exactly. (he taps "REALITY") Let's start with the Aether. Thor, what do we know? Everyone looks toward...THOR, slumped over. Is he asleep? I'm pretty sure he's dead. THOR sulks, looking at the Aether Container Holo: "REALITY" Locations are listed: "SVARTALFHEIM, KNOWHERE, LONDON." 53 The Aether's not a stone, it's more of an angry sludge. My grandfather hid it from Dark Elves in a rock between dimensions that can only be accessed every 5000 years. HIS ROBOTIC EYE drifts off in the wrong direction. Thor bangs his head, resetting his eye. Or...by Jane. She stuck her hand in a rock. Then the Aether stuck itself inside her. Then I took her to Asgard. We were dating... (depressed) We're not anymore. Everyone stares. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 2 - DAY (MOCO) CLOSE ON a holo image of THE ORB: "POWER." Locations are listed: "MORAG ?-2014, KYLN 2014, XANDAR 2014-2018." FIND ROCKET AS HE SLURPS FROM A CONTAINER OF LO MEIN. Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag. He paces on top of the table, past SMART HULK EATING A PINT OF "HUNKA HULKA BURNING FUDGE." That's a person? It's a planet. Quill was a person. Wait, like a planet...in space? Rocket pinches Scott's cheek. Aw, look. It's like a puppy, all happy and everything. 54 You want to go to space, puppy? I'll take you to space. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, SITTING AREA - DAY Scott, Steve, Natasha, Clint, Rocket, and Smart Hulk sit quietly, listening to Nebula. Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir. And that is...? A dominion of death at the very center of celestial existence. (beat) It's the place where Thanos murdered my sister. That hangs heavily. A moment passes. Then... Not it. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, OFFICE - DAY, EARLY Tony, Natasha, and Smart Hulk hash it out. So this `Time Stone' guy...what kind of doctor was he? Strange? Cross between ear-nose-and-throat and rabbit-from-hat. Had a nice place in the Village. Yeah. Sullivan Street. 55 Bleecker. Sullivan and Bleecker. They're cross streets. Wait, he lived in New York? Guys, pick the right year and there were three stones in New York. (beat) Shut the front door... INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 3 - DAY STEVE blocks our view. Okay, we have a plan. Six stones, three teams, one shot. He steps away, revealing the board... EVERYONE EYES THE TANGLE OF LINES CONNECTING SIX STONES TO FOUR LOCATIONS TO TWO YEARS TO TEN HEROES. IT'S INSANE. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAWN DAWN RISES OUTSIDE HUGE WINDOWS. OUR HEROES MARCH PAST IN Five years ago, we lost. All of us. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY THE HEROES GATHER ON THE QUANTUM PLATFORM. We lost friends. We lost family. We lost a part of ourselves. (beat) But today we have a chance to take it all back. Steve takes in the groupings of heroes: RHODEY & NEBULA, NAT & CLINT, THOR & ROCKET, TONY & SCOTT. 56 You have your teams and you have assignments. Get your stone, and get back here. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. He grips HIS SHIELD. Most of us are going back to places we know. That doesn't mean we know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. Improvise, if you have to. (looking around) This is the fight of our lives. And we're going to win. (beat) Whatever it takes. The platform stays quiet. Rocket WHISPERS to Scott: He's pretty good at that... Scott nods enthusiastically. (to Smart Hulk) All right, you heard the man. Stroke those keys, Jolly Green. Smart Hulk taps in commands with HIS PENCIL. LIGHTS Tracking beacons engaged. Clint checks his pocket: A SHRUNKEN BENATAR sits inside. You promise to bring that thing back in one piece? Yeah, sure thing. I'll do my best. That's pretty lame, as far as promises go. SMART HULK STEPS ONTO THE PLATFORM, COMPLETING THE LINEUP. THE PLATFORM BEGINS TO VIBRATE. NATASHA LOOKS AROUND. 57 See you in a minute. Actually, it'll be closer to seven or eight microseconds, give or- SUDDENLY, THEY STRETCH AND VANISH, SHRINKING AWAY. WHOOSH. THE QUANTUM CONSOLE STOPS VIBRATING. HULK'S PENCIL SLOWLY ROLLS TOWARD THE EDGE...AND DROPS OFF- EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY (AVENGERS 1) THE BATTLE OF NEW YORK RAGES. IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ALL, THE AVENGERS GATHER IN A CIRCLE, FACING IMPOSSIBLE ODDS. At the same time, just a block away... EXT. NEW YORK CITY, ALLEY - CONTINUOUS (AVENGERS 1) FLASH! STEVE, SMART HULK, TONY, and SCOTT arrive at the mouth of an alley, just out of sight. Okay, Park Avenue's that way. Let's huddle up. Suits off. They all touch their cuffs, RETRACTING THEIR TIME SUITS. We've all got our assignments. Two stones uptown, one stone down. Stay low, keep an eye on time- Just then, A1 HULK BOUNDS DOWN THE STREET SMASHING THINGS. And Bruce? Maybe smash a few things along the way. For appearances. (taking off his shirt) All right, but I have to say, it seems gratuitous. He half-heartedly smashes a few cars. 58 Grrr...grrr... EXT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM, ROOF - DAY (AVENGERS 1) THE BATTLE OF NEW YORK RAGES. CHITAURI CHARIOTS ZOOM OVER THE VILLAGE. SUDDENLY...BOOM, THE CHARIOTS EXPLODE. ON ONE SIDE OF THE SANCTUM ROOF, A TINY, HOODED FIGURE hurls jagged mandalas into the sky. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOF...SMART HULK LANDS. He heads for a door, but... I'd be careful going that way... He turns to find...THE ANCIENT ONE STARING AT HIM. We just had the floors waxed. SMART HULK THINKS, THEN GROWLS, TRYING TO INTIMIDATE HER. Hulk...does what...Hulk want? Yes, I suppose that would be the case- JUST THEN, ON THE ROOF OPPOSITE, A1 HULK TACKLES A CHITAURI CHARIOT, RIPPING IT IN HALF. HE ROARS, LEAPING AWAY. Smart Hulk blinks, sheepish. The Ancient One looks at him. Care to explain? I'm looking for Dr. Strange. You're about five years too early. Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery, 20 blocks that way. What do you want with him? He finally notices THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO HANGING FROM HER NECK. Well, that, actually. 59 Ah. I'm afraid not. I'm seriously sorry but...I wasn't asking. Smart Hulk cracks his knuckles and moves in. She smiles. You don't want to do this. You're right, I don't. But I need that stone, and I don't have a lot of time to debate it- He reaches for it. THE ANCIENT ONE SLAMS HER PALM INTO HIS CHEST AND BLASTS BRUCE BANNER RIGHT OUT OF SMART HULK. "ASTRAL BANNER" hangs in the air, staring at his frozen Smart Hulk body. He looks at his human hands, overwhelmed. No, no, no- She topples Smart Hulk's body with one finger. Whump. Now. Let's start over, shall we? INT. ASGARD, PALACE, CORRIDOR - DAY (THOR 2) AN ASGARDIAN MAIDEN stands at JANE'S ROOM, handing over A For you, Lady Jane. Um, do you have anything with...pants? Pants? It's okay. Nevermind. Pull back to...ROCKET AND THOR, WATCHING from behind a crypt. Rocket holds a syringe-like EXTRACTION DEVICE. 60 That's Jane. Okay, here's the deal. You're going to charm her, and I'm going to poke her with this thing, extract the Reality Stone, and get gone lickety-split. Thor looks off in the other direction, anxious. Um, I'll be right back. The wine cellar is just down here. My father used to have this barrel of Aakonian ale. Felt like getting hit in the face with a poleaxe. I'll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cups- They hear SOMEONE APPROACHING. Rocket yanks Thor back as...FRIGGA AND HER HANDMAIDENS ENTER THE CORRIDOR. Send Loki some soup. I don't think he's eating. And ask our librarians to pull some volumes from the astronomy shelves. He won't read them, but at least they'll keep him company. Thor watches Frigga and her coterie disappear down the hall. Who's the fancy broad? My mother. She dies today. Oh, jeez. Thor starts to sweat. I can't do this. This is a bad idea. I can't do this... Rocket climbs onto a marble monument. Come here. 61 Thor steps closer. ROCKET SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE. You think you're the only one who's lost people? What do you think we're doing here? I lost the only family I ever had. Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna. All gone. I've lived five meaningless years without them, and every minute has blown Aaskvarian gornads. I get you miss your mom. But she's gone. Really gone. There are plenty of people who are only kind of gone. And you can help them. So, is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs out of your beard, make shmoopy talk to Prettypants, and when she's not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone, and help me get my family back? Thor stares at him a long moment. He wipes his tears away. I guess not. Good. Thank you. I can do this. Great. As Rocket scurries to Jane's door, Thor murmurs to himself. I can do this...I can do this... (beat) I can't do this... (peering through keyhole) All right, heartbreaker. This is our shot... Rocket turns to find...THOR NOWHERE TO BE SEEN. Thor? (holding his temples) 62 I can kill him, and say the Elves did it. STIFF WINDS PELT THE SURFACE OF MORAG. RHODEY STEERS NEBULA AS SHE LOWERS THE ESCAPE POD FROM THE NOW FULL-SIZED BENATAR. That's it, right on that line, Blue. Keep dropping it. Nearby, CLINT SURVEYS THE PLANET. GEYSERS EXPLODE. CLIFFS LOOM. AN ORLONI bites NATASHA's boot. She kicks it away. (to Rhodey) Hey, can we hurry it up? Yeah, come on, chop chop, we're on the clock, here. All that? Really helpful! Clint and Natasha board the Benatar. Rhodey and Nebula remain on the planet's surface. Take care of yourself. Get that stone and come back. No messing around. You guys watch each other's six. BESIDE THE POD, RHODEY AND NEBULA WATCH THE BENATAR TAKE OFF. Coordinates for Vormir are laid in. All they have to do is not fall out. 63 INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - DAY (GUARDIANS) Clint laughs, watching Natasha expertly pilot a spaceship. What? Nothing. Just...we're a long way from Budapest. (pushing the throttle) Further every second. So, all we have to do is hang out, wait for this Quill guy, and follow him to the Power Stone, right? Let's take cover. We're not the only ones in this reality looking for the stones. Hey, who are you talking about right now? Who else is looking for the stones? My father. My sister. And me. MOVE IN ON RHODEY, CONCERNED. You? Where are you? EXT. BATTLEFIELD, ALIEN PLANET - DAY BAD NEBULA CUTS DOWN A KORBINITE SOLDIER WITH DUAL BLADES. She leads Thanos' troops onward as they lay waste to the Korbinite home world. JUST THEN... 64 BLAM! A GRENADE KNOCKS BAD NEBULA TO HER KNEES. TWO KORBINITE RIFLEMEN BEAR DOWN ON HER. Suddenly, A GREEN BLUR LEAPS IN, SLICING THE RIFLEMEN'S THROATS. THE TWO HUGE SOLDIERS DROP... REVEALING GAMORA looking down at her sister. Beat. You're welcome? I didn't ask for your help. And yet you always need it. Father wants us back on the ship. Gamora offers her hand. Bad Nebula stands on her own. Why? He's found an Infinity Stone. Off Bad Nebula's intrigued look... BAD NEBULA and GAMORA study a holo-map. Where? On a planet called "Morag." EXT. BATTLEFIELD, ALIEN PLANET - DAY A DARK FIGURE ADVANCES ACROSS THE SMOKY FIELD, RELENTLESS. Father's plan is finally in motion. One stone isn't six. ALIENS RUN FOR COVER, SCREAMING. SOMETHING CUTS THEM DOWN... 65 It's a start. If he gets them all... THANOS steps from the smoke, armored, wielding A HUGE BLADE. We'll never have to do this again. THREE ALIENS CHARGE HIM. THANOS CUTS THEM DOWN. He wipes blood from his face, and SMILES. He'll miss it. A SMALL FIGHTER FLIES IN, STRAFING HIM. NEVER BREAKING STRIDE, THANOS SLICES IT IN TWO. He looks up to his ship. A BEAM BATHES HIM IN LIGHT... Bad Nebula and Gamora turn as THANOS ENTERS THE FLIGHT DECK. Ronan has located the Power Stone. I'm dispatching you to his ship. He won't like it. Thanos wipes the blood from his blade. His alternative is death. Ronan's obsession clouds his judgement. After Loki, I'm taking no chances. We will not fail you, father. Thanos finally lays his eyes on her. No. You won't. I swear I will make you proud- SUDDENLY, BAD NEBULA STAGGERS, hand to the wall. Sister, what's- 66 Thanos watches, curious, as NEBULA DROPS TO A KNEE. SUDDENLY, A HOLO-PROJECTION OF RHODEY BEAMS FROM HER EYE. So, all we have to do is hang out, wait for this Quill guy, and follow him to the Power Stone, right? Let's take cover. We're not the only ones in this reality looking for the stones. BAD NEBULA SLUMPS, breaking the projection. Gamora goes to her, trying to prop her up. Who was that? I...don't know. My head...splitting... Bad Nebula winces. Gamora looks to Thanos. Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle- Sshhh... Thanos looks down at Bad Nebula. He gently lifts her head with his blade. Something's not right. Bring her to my ship. EXT. STARK TOWER, PENTHOUSE - DAY (AVENGERS 1) Tony swoops onto the helipad outside the wrecked penthouse. INT. STARK TOWER, PENTHOUSE - DAY (AVENGERS 1) THE MIND STONE GLOWS IN LOKI'S SCEPTER. Pull back to see it's in A1 NATASHA'S HANDS, as she stands with... A1 THOR, A1 STEVE, A1 TONY, A1 HULK, AND A1 CLINT (THE ICONIC SHOT FROM AVENGERS 1), all staring down at...LOKI. 67 If it's all the same to you...I'll have that drink now. From behind cover, TONY PEERS AT THE BACK SIDE OF THE Cap, I've got to say that outfit does nothing for your ass. No one asked you to look, Tony. REVEAL TINY SCOTT ON TONY'S SHOULDER. I think you look great, Cap. As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass. Who gets the magic wand? SHIELD's coming up now. Ball's in play. Head's up, Cap. From hiding, Tony eyes A1 NATASHA WITH LOKI'S SCEPTER. INT. STARK TOWER, HALLWAY - DAY STEVE negotiates an empty hallway, head on a swivel. He heads for AN ELEVATOR. Mind Stone's on the move. I'm in position. INT. STARK TOWER, PENTHOUSE - DAY (AVENGERS 1) A1 NATASHA hands LOKI'S SCEPTER to...AGENT SITWELL. He's about to touch the tip when... Careful with that. 68 A1 CLINT pours himself A DRINK at Tony's bar. Unless you want your mind erased. And not in the fun way. Sitwell carries the scepter to THE SERVICE ELEVATOR...WHERE A STRIKE TEAM WAITS. BROCK RUMLOW hits "down." We promise to be extra careful. Scott stares at Sitwell and Rumlow. Who are these guys? SHIELD. Actually, Hydra. But we didn't know that yet. Seriously? `Cause it's kind of obvious they're bad guys. You're small but you're talking loud. A1 THOR WALKS LOKI PAST A1 STEVE. I'm on my way down to coordinate search and rescue. Loki rolls his eyes...AND TRANSFORMS INTO A COPY OF STEVE. "I'm on my way down to coordinate search and rescue." I mean, really, how do you keep your food down? Thor slaps A MUZZLE on Loki, who REVERTS TO HIS OWN FORM. Yes, that's much better. He steers his brother into THE MAIN ELEVATOR. You coming, Stark? 69 Nearby, A1 TONY uses his gauntleted hand to place THE TESSERACT into AN ALUMINUM ATTACHE CASE. One sec, just packing my lunch. All right, you're up, Little Buddy. There's our stone A1 Tony crosses to the elevator. Scott takes position, readying himself. All right. Flick me. Tony flicks Scott with a finger, sending him sailing into the TONY leaps out the window, Bleeding Edge armor forming around him as he falls. A1 Tony joins the others in the elevator. Then... A1 HULK steps up to THE ALREADY CROWDED ELEVATOR. Avengers smile awkwardly. There's no room. (angrily) Hulk take stairs. Tony circles around the building...PASSING THE DESCENDING SERVICE ELEVATOR, CROWDED WITH RUMLOW'S STRIKE TEAM. Okay, Cap, I make ten of them, just passing the 80th floor. Got it. Head to the lobby. Already on my way. INT. STARK TOWER, SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAY (AVENGERS 1) Sitwell, Rumlow, and the STRIKE TEAM descend. 70 Evidence secured, we are en route to Dr. List...No, no hitches at all, Mr. Secretary... The car stops. The doors open...AND OUR STEVE GETS ON. Captain, I thought you were coordinating search and rescue? Change of plans. Steve glances at Rumlow, who's holding THE SCEPTER. Cap. Rumlow. The doors close. Everyone rides in silence. Tension mounts. I got a call from the Secretary's office. I'm going to be running point on the scepter. Behind him, Sitwell and Rumlow exchange a glance. Sir? I don't understand- We've had word there might be an attempt to steal it. Steve reaches for the scepter, but Rumlow holds tight. Afraid we can't allow that, Cap. (pulling out his phone) I'll have to check with the Director- No. Trust me. It's okay... Steve leans in, drawing them all close. Then he whispers: 71 Hail Hydra. INT. STARK TOWER, 10TH FLOOR - DAY (AVENGERS 1) The elevator OPENS. Steve steps out with THE SCEPTER. Sitwell and Rumlow stare after him, amazed. THE DOORS CLOSE. STEVE SMILES TO HIMSELF. INT. STARK TOWER, STAIRWELL - DAY (AVENGERS 1) A1 HULK lumbers down the stairs, taking chunks out of corners in the tiny stairwell. He snorts, growing more pissed off. INT. STARK TOWER, LOBBY - DAY (AVENGERS 1) A1 TONY carries the TESSERACT CASE through THE LOBBY, followed by A1 THOR and LOKI. SWAT TROOPERS clear a path. ONE TURNS ASIDE, RAISING HIS Okay, Thumbelina, you're a go. MOVE IN CLOSE on A1 TONY to see...SCOTT, HIDING IN HIS HAIR. Bombs away. SCOTT DROPS BENEATH TONY'S BLACK SABBATH SHIRT. INT. TONY STARK'S SHIRT - CONTINUOUS (AVENGERS 1) SCOTT slides down Tony's clavicle to the RT. He sniffs. Is that...Axe body spray? Yeah, I had a can in the desk for emergencies. Can we focus, please? 72 I'm going inside you...NOW. SCOTT SQUEEZES BETWEEN A1 TONY'S SKIN AND THE RT. INT. STARK TOWER, LOBBY - DAY (AVENGERS 1) A1 TONY, A1 THOR, and LOKI approach the door. ALEXANDER PIERCE intercepts them with a team of SHIELD AGENTS. Mind if I ask where you're going? We were thinking lunch, then Asgard. And you are? Alexander Pierce. He's the guy behind the guys behind Fury, so don't mess. My friends call me Mr. Secretary. (to Thor) I have to ask you to turn the prisoner over to me. Loki will answer to Odin, himself. No, he'll answer to us. "Odin" can have what's left. (to Tony) And we'll need the case back, too. That's been SHIELD property for over seventy years. I'm not gonna argue who has authority here but jurisdictionally speaking, we are on Stark property. That is my name on the glass... Just give me the case. Across the lobby, TONY OBSERVES FROM BEHIND HIS SWAT HELMET. 73 Move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey out here. INT. TONY STARK'S RT - DAY (AVENGERS 1) Scott studies A TANGLE OF COPPER WIRING. This place is a mess. (finding a wire) You promise you won't die? You're only giving me a minor cardiac dysrhythmia- That doesn't actually sound minor- Tony sees PIERCE reaching for A1 TONY'S CASE. Window's closing. Pull my plug. Here goes... SCOTT YANKS THE WIRE OUT OF ITS SOCKET. IN THE LOBBY, A1 TONY GRIPS HIS CHEST. Stark? A1 Tony SEIZES, dropping. THE TESSERACT CASE CLATTERS TO THE GROUND. PIERCE and A1 THOR kneel to assist. Stark? Somebody get some help! Is it your chest machine? THE LOBBY BUZZES, SHIELD AGENTS RUNNING EVERYWHERE. In the bustle, SCOTT SLIDES OUT OF A1 TONY'S SLEEVE. He SHOVES THE TESSERACT CASE HARD. It SPINS across the floor... RIGHT INTO TONY'S HAND. Tony walks toward a side door. 74 Meet me in the alley. I'm just gonna grab a slice at Famous Ray's- BUT AS TONY PASSES THE STAIRWELL DOOR...HULK BANGS IT OPEN, SMASHING TONY IN THE FACE, SENDING HIM TUMBLING. A1 HULK BASHES HIS WAY THROUGH THE LOBBY. The Tesseract Case hits the floor, popping open. THE TESSERACT FALLS OUT, spinning past Tiny Scott... STOPPING AT LOKI'S FEET. Loki stares at it in disbelief. He glances at A1 Thor and Pierce giving A1 Tony first aid. THEN LOKI CALMLY REACHES DOWN WITH HIS MANACLED HANDS, GRASPS THE TESSERACT...AND TELEPORTS AWAY. Scott stares, stunned. That wasn't supposed to happen, was it? A1 THOR LOOKS UP, REALIZING... SHIELD TEAMS FAN OUT, ON ALERT. INT. STARK TOWER, 14TH FLOOR - DAY (AVENGERS 1) STEVE heads down a hall, SCEPTER IN HAND. Building-wide alert, all units. Target Loki, maximum force. Tony? What's going on? Tell me you got that cube- Strike Teams, clear Forty, then work down. Before Steve can hide...A1 STEVE ROUNDS THE CORNER. Oh, great. Disregard. I have eyes on Loki, Fourteenth Floor. 75 STEVE GENTLY LAYS THE SCEPTER DOWN, AND PULLS OFF HIS SHIELD. I'm not Loki. And I don't want to hurt you. A1 STEVE PULLS HIS SHIELD OFF HIS BACK. You're not going to get the chance- A1 STEVE KICKS STEVE IN THE FACE. Steve stumbles. Forgot about that one. They grapple. Both their shields fall to the ground... THEY BOTH STAMP ON THEM, simultaneously flipping the shields back to their arms. A1 Steve looks impressed. A1 STEVE SWINGS. STEVE DUCKS, HAMMERING HIM. A1 Steve wipes the blood from his lip, squaring off. I can do this all day- Yeah, I know... They battle on. A1 Steve tackles Steve, knocking his shield aside, RIPPING OPEN ONE OF STEVE'S BELT COMPARTMENTS: THE COMPASS FALLS OUT, OPENING TO REVEAL PEGGY'S PICTURE. A1 Steve goes cold. He picks up the compass, FLABBERGASTED. Where'd you get this? PX. Camp Lehigh. 1943. A1 Steve stares at Steve, eyes narrowing. You've got a lot of nerve. HE HAMMERS STEVE ACROSS THE HALL. Steve goes skidding. He groans, looking up to see...HE'S INCHES FROM THE SCEPTER. A1 STEVE moves in. STEVE whips around, touching THE SCEPTER to A1 Steve's chest. A1 STEVE'S EYES GO BLACK. HE FREEZES. 76 Steve stares, panting. Finally, he picks up the compass from the floor, then considers A1 STEVE'S ASS. That is America's ass. EXT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM, ROOF - DAY (AVENGERS 1) SMART HULK'S BODY lies slumped on an Adirondack chair, a floppy sun hat covering his face. I wish I could help you, Bruce... THE ANCIENT ONE waters a rooftop garden. She looks to ASTRAL BANNER, who's only just getting used to being see-through. But if I were to give up the Time Stone to help your reality, I'd be dooming my own. Yeah, with all due respect, I'm not sure the science supports that. And yet, you're the one currently standing in the middle of my hydrangeas. Banner looks down to see, indeed, he has phased through the middle of the hydrangeas. He steps out of it. Lady, I just want to borrow your necklace- At what cost? SHE CONJURES A MAGICAL PROJECTION OF THE INFINITY STONES, SPINNING IN UNISON. A TUNNEL OF GOLDEN LIGHT POURS FORTH. The Infinity Stones create the experience you know as the flow of time. Remove one of the stones, and the flow splits. She plucks the GREEN TIME STONE out of the array: A SMALLER, BLACKENED RIVER BRANCHES OFF FROM THE FIRST. 77 Now, your timeline might benefit. My new one...would definitely not. SHE GESTURES. OUR CAMERA ZOOMS INTO THE BLACKENED TUNNEL... TUNNEL POV: HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE RUN AS WE FLY OVER A CROWDED STREET, UP TO...THE BURNING HONG KONG SANCTUM. In this new branch reality, without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness, our world would be overrun... MOVE UP TO SEE DORMAMMU IN THE SKY. HE OPENS HIS MOUTH... BACK ON THE ROOF...THE ANCIENT ONE PLUCKS MORE STONES FROM THE GOLDEN RIVER, CREATING FIVE MORE BLACKENED TRIBUTARIES. For each stone you remove, you'll create a new, vulnerable timeline. Millions will suffer. (beat) Now tell me, Doctor. Can your science prevent all that? No. But it can erase it. Astral Banner reaches in and grabs THE VIRTUAL TIME STONE. Because once we're done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline. At the moment it was taken. So chronologically, in that reality, the stone never left. HE PUTS THE TIME STONE BACK. THE BLACK TIMELINE DISAPPEARS. You're leaving out the most important part, though. In order to put the stones back, you'd have to survive. We will. I will. I promise. I can't risk this reality on a promise. 78 It is the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone- Yeah? Then why the hell did Strange give it away? The Ancient One freezes. What did you say? Strange gave Thanos the Time Stone. Willingly? Why? Don't know. Maybe he made a mistake. Or I did. The Ancient One looks out over a recovering NYC. Strange is meant to be the best of us. Then he must have had a reason. I fear you may be right... Finally, she waves her hand and...WHOOSH! HE REINTEGRATES INTO THE SMART HULK BODY. Smart Hulk gets up, WOOZY. SHE REMOVES THE TIME STONE FROM THE EYE, HANDING IT TO HIM. Thank you. I'm counting on you, Bruce. (re. the city behind her) We all are. 79 BAD NEBULA HANGS SUSPENDED. CABLES travel from her "brain" to a GLOWING WALL OF DATABANKS, which silhouettes... THANOS. He regards her for a moment. Then... Run diagnostics. Show me her memory file. At the console, EBONY MAW SCANS NEBULA'S INFORMATION. GAMORA WATCHES, TORN. SOON...AN ALERT FLASHES. Sir, the file appears...entangled. It was a memory, but not hers. (dawning on him) There's another consciousness sharing her network. Another Nebula. Impossible. This duplicate carries a time stamp...from nine years in the future. Where is this "other Nebula?" In our solar system. On Morag. Can you access her? Yes. The two are linked. THANOS PEERS INTO BAD NEBULA'S GLASSY EYES... Search the duplicate's memory for Infinity Stones. Maw works the console. Thanos steps aside as BAD NEBULA'S BODY QUIVERS. AFTER A BEAT, A BEAM SHOOTS OUT OF HER EYE... PROJECTING AN IMAGE OF AVENGERS COMPOUND: 80 STEVE, TONY, RHODEY, SCOTT, SMART HULK, ROCKET, NATASHA, CLINT, AND THOR GATHER IN THE LIVING AREA. -the Stones have been in a lot of places throughout history. Our history. Not all of them are going to be a fun drop-in. Which means we've got to pick our targets. Exactly. Let's start here- Freeze image. THE IMAGE FREEZES. THANOS STARES, RECOGNIZING THEM. Terrans? Avengers. Unruly wretches. He gestures to A BLURRY REFLECTION WITHIN THE HOLOGRAM. What's this reflection. Amplify this, Maw. EBONY MAW ZOOMS IN, REVEALING...A REFLECTION OF NEBULA. I don't understand. Two Nebulas? Thanos walks into the hologram, studying the faces. No. The same Nebula. From two different times. (to Ebony Maw) Set course for Morag. And scan the duplicate's memories. (beat) I want to see everything... 81 INT. ASGARD, PALACE, CORRIDOR - DAY (THOR 2) Frigga walks down a corridor, alone. THOR SNEAKS FROM COLUMN TO COLUMN, FOLLOWING HER. She PAUSES, sensing something. Thor HIDES. When he peers again, FRIGGA IS GONE. Then he turns around to find FRIGGA STANDING BESIDE HIM. Thor jumps. What are you doing? Mother! What? Nothing. Hello. You're better off leaving the sneaking to your brother. (re. his bathrobe) What are you wearing? I always wear this. It's one of my favorites. And what's wrong with your eye? Oh, that. You remember the...Battle of Harokin. I took a...broadsword to the face? He trails off, at a loss, staring at his dead mom. Frigga gently lays her hand on his cheek...READING HIM. Oh. You're not the Thor I know at all, are you? Yes, I am- I was raised by witches, boy. I see with more than eyes, you know that. (eyeing him) I can see the future hasn't been kind to you, has it? I didn't say I was from the future... 82 Thor... Frigga gives her son a stern, "don't lie to me" look. Thor stares at his mom a long moment. Then, he cracks: I'm totally from the future. Yes, you are. I need to talk to you. We can talk. Frigga GRABS Thor by the cloak and yanks him away. INT. ASGARD, PALACE, JANE FOSTER'S CHAMBER - DAY (THOR 2) CLOSE ON A PAIR OF MODERN BOOTS BENEATH AN ASGARDIAN GOWN. TILT UP TO FIND...JANE FOSTER. She studies the outfit. Behind her, ROCKET RAISES THE EXTRACTION DEVICE OVER HIS INT. ASGARD, PALACE, FRIGGA'S CHAMBER - DAY (THOR 2) FRIGGA sits with THOR in her chambers. ...and then it was done. His head over there. Body over there. And me in the middle. Just an idiot with an axe. You're no idiot. You're here, aren't you? Seeking counsel from the smartest person in Asgard? Yeah, I guess. An idiot, no. A failure, absolutely. 83 That's a little harsh- Quite a colossal one, by the sound of it. Okay, maybe just stop talking. And you know what that makes you? Just like everyone else. I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, though. Everyone fails at "who they're supposed to be," Thor. The measure of a person, of a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are. Thor stares at her, biting back emotions. I've really missed you, Mum. INT. ASGARD, PALACE, CORRIDOR - DAY (THOR 2) ROCKET TEARS DOWN THE HALL, EXTRACTION DEVICE IN HAND. I got it I got it I got it! A TROOP OF EINHERJAR CHASE AFTER HIM. INT. ASGARD, PALACE, FRIGGA'S CHAMBER - DAY (THOR 2) THOR looks at THE OBSERVATORY: Dark Elves will soon attack. Mum, I have to tell you something- No, son. You don't. You've come to repair your future, not mine. But your future- 84 Is none of my business. Thor stares at her, torn. THEN ROCKET RACES INTO THE ROOM. (to Frigga) Hi. You must be Mom. (to Thor, re. the device) I got the thing. Come on, we gotta move- Thor looks to Frigga. I wish we had more time- This was a gift. Now, go be the man you're meant to be. (beat) And eat a salad. Thor smiles. He and Rocket activate their time suits. Three...two- No. Wait. THOR DRAMATICALLY HOLDS OUT HIS HAND. A long moment passes. What am I looking at? Sometimes it takes a second. Then...MJOLNIR SAILS INTO HER SON'S HAND. She grins, proud. (relieved) Still worthy. Mother and son look at each other for the last time. Goodbye, Mum. Goodbye, Son. THEN, WHOOSH! THOR AND ROCKET DISAPPEAR. 85 Suddenly...THE PALACE RUMBLES. Frigga looks to the window, WHERE A DARK ELF WARSHIP DECLOAKS. SHE REACHES FOR A SWORD. PRELAP: "COME AND GET YOUR LOVE," BY REDBONE. EXT. MORAG, ABANDONED CITY - DAY (GUARDIANS) PETER QUILL, in RED, PLEATHER TRENCH COAT AND HEADPHONES, dances through the ruins of an alien city. PULL BACK TO...NEBULA AND RHODEY WATCHING FROM BEHIND A ROCK. So, he's an idiot. Yes. Quill spins, arms out, eyes shut. When the horizon finally settles...he sees A METAL MAN STANDING THERE WAITING FOR HIM. Oh, fu- BAM! RHODEY DECKS QUILL IN THE FACE. Quill drops, out cold. Sorry about that. I know you guys were teammates and everything. Do you hear me complaining? Nebula rifles through Quill's sack. She pulls out AN What is that? The tool of a thief. Come on. They set out toward the RUINED CITY. INT. MORAG, TEMPLE VAULT - DAY (GUARDIANS) WHIR, CLICK. TWO HUGE, STONE DOORS SLIDE OPEN, REVEALING NEBULA AND RHODEY. SHE STEPS IN. RHODEY TRIES TO STOP HER. 86 Hang on. This would be about the time the spikes come out, you know, with the skeletons still on them? What are you talking about? I'm just saying, when you break into a place called, "The Temple of the Power Stone", there are usually... Ahead, they see...THE POWER STONE ORB HOVERING ABOVE ITS PEDESTAL, SURROUNDED BY A WEB OF LASER THREADS. Traps and stuff. (Nebula steps inside) Okay, don't say I didn't warn you. Rhodey scans the laser web, strategizing. These are photovoltaic lasers on a constantly shifting matrix. Gonna be damn near impossible to neutralize unless we- SUDDENLY, NEBULA REACHES HER CYBERNETIC ARM THROUGH THE WEB. SHE GRABS THE ORB...BUT THE WEB GRIPS HER, FRYING HER ARM. She pulls out the orb, but sees Rhodey staring at HER I wasn't always like this. He sees actual emotion somewhere inside her. Favor his exoskeletal leg braces as he softens. Yeah, me either. I guess we do the best with what we've got, huh? SHE HANDS HIM THE ORB WITH JUST THE GHOST OF A SMILE. Let's get out of here. Place gives me the creeps. Sync up. Three... two...one... 87 RHODEY TAPS HIS CUFF, SHRINKING AWAY. Nebula goes for hers...BUT HER EYES ROLL BACK. SHE COLLAPSES, SEIZING VIOLENTLY, THEN GOING STILL. Her eyes snap open, projecting a hologram of...THANOS. What's wrong? INT. SANCTUARY-2, INTERROGATION CELL - DAY BACK IN THE INTERROGATION CELL, BAD NEBULA'S EYE BEAMS: IN THANOS' LODGE, THE AVENGERS SURROUND A ONE-ARMED THANOS. THANOS STUDIES HIS HOLO-FUTURE-SELF, WATCHING HIS DESTINY You murdered trillions. You should be grateful. Where are the stones? THANOS SMIRKS, PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER. Gone. Reduced to atoms. You used them two days ago! I used the stones to destroy the stones. The work is done. It always will be... HE STEPS FORWARD, FINISHING HIS OWN THOUGHT. THANOS (HOLO) (CONT'D) THANOS (CONT'D) I AM INEVITABLE- I AM INEVITABLE. Thanos nods to Maw, who freezes the program. THANOS WALKS THROUGH THE HOLOGRAM, STUDYING THE HEROES. What did you do to them? Nothing. Yet. (piecing it together) 88 They're not trying to stop something I'm going to do in our time. They're trying to undo something I've already done in theirs. (uneasy) The stones. I found them all. I won. Tipped the cosmic scales to balance. Sire. This is your future? My destiny. He stares, mind whirling. He nods. THE MEMORY RESUMES. He's lying. My father is many things. A liar is not one of them. Thank you, daughter. Perhaps I've treated you too- WHUMP. THOR CUTS OFF THANOS' HEAD. THE VIEW LINGERS AS "NEBULA" STARES AT HER DEAD FATHER. THANOS STUDIES HIS SEVERED HEAD...AND SMILES. And that is destiny fulfilled. Gamora stares, torn. But Ebony Maw fumes on Thanos' behalf. Sire. Your daughter is a traitor. EBONY MAW GESTURES: CABLES WRAP AROUND NEBULA'S NECK. SHE AWAKENS, PANICKED. She looks up at Thanos. (choking) No. Please, father. That's not me. I would never betray you. Please- 89 Thanos UNWRAPS the cord. He touches his daughter's face. Ssh, child. I know. And you'll have the chance to prove it... INT. MORAG, TEMPLE VAULT - DAY (GUARDIANS) ZZZT. ON THE FLOOR, NEBULA'S EYES SNAP OPEN, HORRIFIED. He knows... BOOTS POUND ACROSS THE ROCKS. NEBULA RUNS FLAT OUT, DESPERATE, HEADING FOR THE ESCAPE POD. INT. ESCAPE POD - DAY (GUARDIANS) NEBULA rushes to the console and opens A COMMUNICATION LINK. Barton, Romanoff, come in. We have a problem. Thanos knows! Thanos- Suddenly, A SHADOW falls over the Pod. Nebula looks out the cockpit window... AS A TRACTOR BEAM PULLS THE ENTIRE POD SKYWARD. EXT. NEW YORK CITY, ALLEY - (AVENGERS 1) IN THE ALLEY, Steve drops down from the building. He hears A WHISTLE. TONY waves from behind a crashed car. We've got a problem. STEVE huddles with TONY and SCOTT. How could you lose it? What do you want? I got hit in the head with a Hulk! 90 You said we only had one shot. This was our shot. We shot it. It was six stones or nothing! Six stones- You're not helping- You ruined the Time Heist! Okay, okay, Loki's from Asgard, he's comfortable there. Knows the restaurants. It's a safe bet he visits home. If we can just grab This-Thor and explain the situation, he and I can fly- Loki could be anywhere in the universe. We'd be old men before we found him. As Steve and Scott debate, MOVE IN ON TONY, MIND WHIRLING... What other options did we have on the Tesseract? Whoa, whoa. We don't have any other options. We can't go to any other times. No do-overs! We've only got one particle left, each. Use it now, that's it, bye-bye, we don't come home. But if we don't try, nobody else comes home, either. I got it! There's another way to re-take the Tesseract, and acquire new particles. (to Steve) Military installation, Garden State. Steve eyes Tony, BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND. 91 When were they both there? I have a vaguely exact idea. How vague? Hang on, what's in New Jersey? I know they were there, and I know how I know. STEVE STUDIES TONY A LONG MOMENT... Looks like we're improvising. Wait! What are you improvising? Scott, take this back to the Compound. All right, suits on. Try these coordinates. 04-07-19-70... Steve- Cap- Captain America, if you do this and he's wrong...you're not coming back. Steve and Tony let the weight of that sink in. He's right. Even so, Tony turns to Steve. You trust me? I do. THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER, THEN...CLICK. THEY BOTH HIT THEIR CUFFS. TONY AND STEVE SHRINK TO NOTHING... 92 EXT. NEW JERSEY WOODS - DAY (1970) CUE MUSIC: "HEY LAWDY MAMA," STEPPENWOLF. A 1970 Oldsmobile motors down a wooded road. The bumper sticker reads: "NUFF SAID." At the wheel, STAN LEE (48), LONG HAIR, MOUSTACHE, OPEN SHIRT, sings along to the radio, TWO LADIES at his side. He passes by AN ARMY BASE, throwing a peace sign to A GUARD. Make love, not war, baby! He roars off, passing A FADED SIGN: "U.S. ARMY - CAMP LEHIGH - BIRTHPLACE OF CAPTAIN AMERICA." MOVE INTO THE BASE... You weren't actually born here, right? EXT. CAMP LEHIGH - DAY (1970) Tony and Steve round the corner, TONY IN A LAB COAT and STEVE IN GREEN KHAKIS, LOW-PULLED CAP, AND MIRRORED SUNGLASSES. The idea of me was. (looking around) All right. If I was SHIELD and I wanted to hide my quasi-fascistic black site, where would I hide it? In plain sight. Steve nods at A MAN IN A GRAY SUIT approaching a building, "MUNITIONS." He opens the door with a retro-tech PUNCH CARD. TONY TOUCHES HIS GLASSES: HE X-RAYS INTO THE GROUND, ILLUMINATING...TWENTY FLOORS OF SECRET, UNDERGROUND BASE. INT. CAMP LEHIGH, ELEVATOR - DAY (1970) Muzak plays as STEVE and TONY ride down with A FEMALE SHIELD 93 She stares awkwardly at Tony. Steve keeps his hat down. Ding. The doors open. Tony exits, then turns back to Steve. Good luck with that mission, Captain. Good luck with your project, Doctor. Tony ducks out. The doors close. The Agent turns to Steve. You new here? Not exactly. INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, ARCHIVES - DAY (1970) TONY searches HIGH, CROWDED ARCHIVE SHELVES. Come on, you little hexahedron, where are you hiding? Finally, he spots A HIGH TECH SAFE. He grabs a briefcase, then NANOS A GAUNTLET, FRYING THE SAFE'S LOCK. It opens revealing...THE TESSERACT. Tony smiles. You may not know it now, but someday you're going to be a real pain-in-the-ass. Just then...THE ARCHIVE DOOR OPENS. Hey, Arnim, you in here? TONY LOCKS THE CUBE IN THE BRIEFCASE JUST BEFORE... HOWARD STARK (49) APPEARS, carrying ROSES AND A CAN OF SAUERKRAUT. TONY STARES, STUNNED. Hey, I'm looking for Dr. Zola. You seen him? No. Haven't seen a soul. 94 Tony stands in front of his father, overwhelmed. Howard looks at him, a bit suspicious. I know you? From his pocket, TONY GENERATES A BADGE OUT OF NANO-TECH. He holds it out. No, sir. Just visiting from MIT. That so? Got a name? Howard... Easy to remember- Potts. I'm Howard Stark. (shaking hands) You seem a little green around the gills, Potts. Need some air? That'd be swell. Tony distractedly walks away, leaving the briefcase. Need the briefcase? INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PYM'S LAB - DAY (1970) CLOSE ON: AN ANT. A phone continues to ring. Then... Hello? PULL BACK: THE ANT CRAWLS IN AN ANTFARM ON A LAB SHELF. Dr. Pym? 95 That would be the number you called, yes. PAN across the shelf to A CHART OF WASP MATURATION. This is Captain Stevens, from shipping. We have a package for you. KEEP PANNING to A PROTOTYPE ANT-MAN HELMET. So bring it up. That's the thing, sir, we can't. ARRIVE ON...HANK PYM (20's), in brown hair and lab coat. Maybe I'm confused. Isn't that your job? It's just...sir, the box is glowing. And to be honest, a couple of our mail guys aren't feeling great- They didn't open it, did they?! INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, HALLWAY - DAY (1970) A DOOR MARKED, "DR. HENRY PYM," flies open. Hank exits, fuming, brushing past...STEVE. Steve watches Hank stalk off...THEN DUCKS INTO HANK'S LAB. INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, ELEVATOR - DAY (1970) HOWARD and TONY step onto AN ELEVATOR. The doors shut. Sauerkraut and a bouquet...big night planned? 96 (lifting one at a time) My wife's expecting. And too much time at the office. Tony puzzles the dates out in his head... Congratulations. Thanks. How far along is she? Gee, I suppose... (indicating) ...this far. She's at the point where she can't stand the sound of my chewing. So I guess I'll be eating in the pantry again. I have a little girl. TONY SMILES. He's talking about the man-he's-talking-to's granddaughter, fifty years before she's born. A girl would be nice. Less chance she'd turn out exactly like me. Would that be so bad? Let's just say the greater good hasn't always outweighed my own self interest. The elevator doors open. INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PYM'S LAB - DAY (1970) STEVE searches Hank's lab, finally opening the fridge to find...A TRAY OF BRAND NEW PYM PARTICLES. 97 INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, HALLWAY - DAY (1970) Steve exits Hank's lab and heads for the elevator. But it opens, revealing THE FEMALE AGENT FROM EARLIER, WITH AN M.P. You've never seen either of these men before? No. But I have an eye for this. Something looked fishy. Describe `fishy'. One of them had a hippie beard. We talking Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry? Definitely Mungo Jerry. (over walkie-talkie) This is Chesler. We need every available agent to sub-level 6. We have a potential breach. Steve ducks through the nearest door... INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PEGGY'S OFC. - DAY (1970) Steve enters a darkened office. A glass wall separates it from another bullpen. Then he sees something on the desk. He stares, stunned, at two photos: one features PEGGY CARTER STANDING WITH JFK. THE OTHER IS OF SKINNY STEVE. Steve turns the desk nameplate around: "MARGARET CARTER." Steve realizes that even twenty-five years later, Peggy never forgot about him. Just then, THE BULLPEN DOOR FLIES OPEN. LIGHTS SNAP ON, revealing PEGGY CARTER (49), talking to someone in the hall. So, send them in. 98 They're trying, ma'am, but Braddock's unit has been stopped by lightning strikes. Oh, for the love of- I'll find the weather projections. You call Braddock and tell him to shelter in place. Assuming he's bright enough to come out of the rain. Yes, ma'am. Steve stares at her from the darkness, STUNNED. Peggy rifles through a file cabinet. Here we are... She flips through a file, reading. In the darkness behind her, Steve approaches. Peggy reads something disturbing. Crikey O'Reilly. (calling out) Sergeant? Hang up and call Air Command. Braddock needs back up, immediately. Ma'am? Those aren't lightning strikes he's looking at... She slaps the file closed and hurries out. Steve stares after her a long moment. EXT. CAMP LEHIGH - DAY (1970) Howard and Tony approach a WAITING LIMO. Got any names, yet? If it's a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo. 99 You might let that stew a while. You've got time. What are you, couple years older than me? Yeah. I guess. Let me ask you a question. When your kid was born...were you nervous? Wildly. Did you feel qualified? Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing? I pieced it together as I went along. I thought about what my dad did... My old man never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt. I tried to hold onto the good stuff. Dad dropped the odd pearl, here and there. Like what? "No amount of money ever bought a second of time." That's good. Smart guy. He did his best. 100 I tell you, this kid's not even here yet, but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him. Tony takes this in, GRATIFIED. Just then...EDWIN JARVIS (56) opens the limo door. Besides, if I fall down on the fathering job, old Jarvis is ready to pick up the slack. Isn't that right? Indeed, sir. I shall endeavor to teach the lad the rudiments of judo. Tony smiles at his old friend. As Jarvis gets in the car, Tony notices...STEVE WAITING BEHIND A JEEP. TIME TO GO. Howard turns to shake Tony's hand. Well, good to meet you, Potts. You're going to do fine, Howard. Thanks. See you around? Count on it... As he gets into his car, Howard looks to Jarvis. Have we met him before? We've met a lot of people, sir. Seems very familiar. (beat) Weird beard. The Sanctuary-2 cruises ominously through space. 101 INT. SANCTUARY-2, PRISON CELL - DAY WHACK! NEBULA GOES TUMBLING ACROSS THE FLOOR. She gets to her knees, looking up at...BAD NEBULA, GLARING DOWN AT HER. You're weak. I'm you- Shut up! BAD NEBULA PUNCHES GOOD NEBULA DOWN. GOOD NEBULA GROANS AS BAD NEBULA RIPS OFF HER TIME-SPACE GPS. THEN GAMORA ENTERS. Nebula softens, taking in her (once dead) sister. You could stop this. You know you want to. (off Gamora's look) Did you see what happens in the future? Thanos finds the Soul Stone. MOVE IN ON GAMORA, WHEELS TURNING... You want to know how he does that? You want to know what he does to you- BAD NEBULA SMACKS HER THE HARDEST YET, THEN LEANS IN WITH A JAGGED INSTRUMENT OF TORTURE. You disgust me...but that doesn't mean you're useless. SHE PRIES OFF THE ORANGE PANEL FROM GOOD NEBULA'S HEAD. Gamora takes in this new development... INT. SANCTUARY-2, THRONE ROOM - DAY Bad Nebula enters to find Thanos on his throne. She hands him Good Nebula's TIME-SPACE GPS. He smiles. 102 Bad Nebula affixes Good Nebula's orange panel onto her head. How do I look? THE BENATAR approaches Vormir. INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - SPACE NATASHA and CLINT stand on the flight deck, staring at THE Under different circumstances, this would be totally awesome. Clint and Natasha eye THE BENATAR resting on a sand dune. Clint fires a Pym Particle. WHOOSH, THE ENTIRE SHIP DISAPPEARS. CLINT lifts THE SHRUNKEN BENATAR and tucks it in his pocket. CLINT AND NATASHA TREK ACROSS THE DUNES OF VORMIR, EXT. VORMIR, MIDWAY UP THE MOUNTAIN - DAY Natasha and Clint climb, ragged. They approach AN ARCHWAY. Really starting to regret my choice here. Yeah. I'm gonna bet the raccoon didn't have to climb a mountain. I don't think technically he's a raccoon... Whatever. He eats garbage- 103 THEY HEAR SOMETHING. THEY WHIRL, WEAPONS UP. A HOODED I assure you, you have nothing to fear from me. Creepy. Welcome Natasha, daughter of Ivan. Clint, son of Edith. Creepier. Who are you? Consider me a guide. To you, and to all who seek the Soul Stone. Great. You show us where it is, and we'll be on our way. The figure removes his hood, revealing...THE RED SKULL. Oh, liebchen. If only it were that easy... EXT. VORMIR, MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY START ON JAGGED ROCKS. TILT UP TO SEE SKULL, NATASHA, and CLINT staring down from the ALTAR. What you seek lies in front of you. As does what you fear. The Stone is down there? For one of you. For the other... (smiling it away) The Stone demands a sacrifice. In order to take it, you must leave behind that which you love. 104 SKULL POINTS A BONY FINGER DOWN THE WELL. A soul for a soul. Natasha and Clint stare down the well, stunned. RED SKULL STARES DOWN THE WELL, robes whipping in the wind. Maybe he's full of shit. FIFTY FEET AWAY, AT THE MONOLITHS, NATASHA AND CLINT HUDDLE. I don't think so. Why, because he knew your daddy's name? I didn't. (off his look) Thanos left here with the stone, and without his daughter. You really think that's a coincidence? They both look out at the well, heavy. (under her breath) Whatever it takes... (under his breath) Whatever it takes... Natasha goes to Clint, resolved. If we don't get the stone, billions of people are going to stay dead. Then I guess we both know who it has to be. Yeah. Guess we do. They take each other's hand. A long goodbye beat. Except... 105 I'm starting to think we don't mean the same person. For the last five years, I've been trying to do one thing -- get to right here. This is all it's been about. Bringing everybody back. Do not get all decent on me- You think I want to do it? I'm trying to save your life, you idiot- And I don't want you to. (beat) Nat. You know what I've done. What I am now. Your life's worth ten of mine- I don't judge people by their worst mistakes- Maybe you should- You didn't. --- That stops him. He looks in her eyes, then down, giving in. You're a pain in my ass, you know that? She relaxes for the briefest moment. Just then, CLINT SWEEPS OUT HER LEGS, PINNING HER DOWN. Tell my family I love them. SHE REVERSES, SENDING HIM TUMBLING. Tell them yourself. SHE FIRES A WIDOW'S BITE INTO HIS CHEST AND MAKES A BREAK FOR THE CLIFF. SHE'S HALFWAY THERE WHEN... 106 BOOM! AN EXPLODING ARROW KNOCKS HER OFF HER FEET. Clint races past her...leaping off edge of the cliff. Just as he falls... NATASHA TACKLES HIM IN MID-AIR. They drop, but NATASHA SHOOTS HER GRAPPLING LINE INTO THE CLIFF. THEY SLAM INTO THE CLIFFSIDE. She attaches the other end of her grappling line to Clint's belt...saving his life. She slides, but he reaches out and grabs her...saving hers. Damn you. They hang there a long, terrible moment. CLINT'S GRASP STARTS TO LOOSEN. Finally, she looks him in the eye. Let me go. No. Please no... The two friends stare at each other, a lifetime between them. It's okay... Natasha, no- Then Natasha Romanoff kicks off the cliff wall, yanking out of Clint's grasp. She falls... Clint dangles from the grappling hook, staring down, helpless, stifling his scream. WHOOSH! THE WHOLE WORLD GOES WHITE. EXT. VORMIR, BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY When the light fades, CLINT LIES FLOATING IN SPACE. The camera rotates until we see...IT'S A REFLECTION OF THE SKY. CLINT LIES IN THE POOL AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN. He sits up and opens his hand to see THE SOUL STONE. His eyes well. 107 INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY THE PENCIL FINALLY CLATTERS TO A STOP AS... WHOOSH, CLINT GROWS INTO THE PRESENT ALONGSIDE THE OTHERS: SMART HULK HOLDS THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO, SCOTT HAS THE SCEPTER, RHODEY THE ORB, ROCKET & THOR THE EXTRACTION DEVICE, AND TONY & STEVE THE TESSERACT. NEBULA RETRACTS HER TIME SUIT. Everyone looks around, exhausted. Amazed. Are you telling me that actually worked? Did we get them all? CLINT DROPS TO HIS KNEES. Steve turns, concerned. Clint? Are you okay? Clint stares, haunted. SMART HULK realizes... Where's Nat? (everyone stares) Clint looks up at them, eyes glassy. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RIVER - DAWN SMART HULK, eyes red, stands beside a bench on the dock. Behind him, STEVE, TONY, THOR, AND CLINT STARE OUT, GRIEVING. Do we know if she had family? Yeah. Us. Thor turns, thrown. Why are you doing that? I'm just asking a question- 108 Why are we talking as if she's dead? We have the stones. Bring her back. C'mon, stop this shit. Clint squeezes away tears. We can't get her back. What's he talking about? Of course, we can. It can't be undone. That's why. No offense, but you're...a very earthly being. We're talking about space magic, here. "Can't" seems a little definitive, don't you think? Well, I know I'm a little outside my pay grade here, but, she still isn't here, is she? That's my point- It can't be undone. At least that's what the red, floating guy said. But why don't you go talk to him, okay? Why don't you grab your hammer and fly to that place and talk to him. IT CAN'T BE UNDONE. (beat) It was supposed to be me. She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone. She bet her life on it. That lands heavily on all of them. A moment passes. THEN SMART HULK HURLS THE BENCH INTO THE WATER. It skips across the surface like a stone. She's not coming back. We have to make it worth it. We have to. 109 We will. PULL BACK, LEAVING OUR MOURNERS IN TABLEAU... INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY ALL SIX INFINITY STONES rest behind safety glass. SOON, ROBOTIC ARMS ENTER FRAME, PLUCKING UP THE POWER STONE. TONY operates the arms as ROCKET and SMART HULK watch. The robot arms swing the stone over to...A NEW IRON MAN GAUNTLET. NANO-TECH SHIFTS AND SLIDES, HOLDING IT IN PLACE. Smart Hulk releases a deep breath. THE COMPLETED GAUNTLET sits in a cradle, SIX INFINITY STONES EMBEDDED IN THE BACK. Pull back to find... SCOTT, THOR, CLINT, RHODEY, and STEVE watching TONY AND All right. The glove's ready. Question is, who's gonna snap their freaking fingers? Everyone stares a beat. Then, THOR REACHES FOR THE GAUNTLET. I'll do it. Whoa, whoa, what are you doing- Thor, we haven't decided who's putting that on. Oh. Were all of you just waiting for the right opportunity? Maybe I was getting around to it- We should at least discuss it- 110 Staring at the thing isn't going to bring everybody back, is it? Look, I'm the strongest Avenger. It's my responsibility. Fate wills it so. Hold on, hold on- Stop it! Let me do this. Let me do something good. Something right- That thing is channeling enough energy to light up a continent. You're in no condition- What do you think is coursing through my veins right now? Cheez Whiz? Lightning. Smart Hulk steps toward the Gauntlet. Lightning won't help you, pal. It's gotta be me. (approaching) You saw what those stones did to Thanos. They almost killed --- him. None of you could survive. And how do we know you can? We don't. But the radiation's mostly gamma. (beat) It's like I was made for this... INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY THE QUANTUM TUNNEL LIES IN DARKNESS. Then, clack, the lights come on, revealing... NEBULA, STARING UP AT THE WAITING MACHINE. 111 INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY SMART HULK STUDIES THE GAUNTLET. The moment of truth. Good to go? Let's do it. Okay, remember, everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago, you're just bringing them back...to today. Don't change anything from the last five years. Got it? Got it. PAN AROUND as the Avengers ready themselves: STEVE steps forward, shield on his arm. SCOTT deploys his helmet. RHODEY readies his repulsors. ROCKET covers his raccoon junk and hides behind THOR. TONY armors up, then nanos a shield to protect CLINT beside him. Friday, why don't you go ahead and activate Barn Door Protocol? STEEL DOORS SLIDE SHUT ALL AROUND THE WORKSHOP. FINALLY, SMART HULK HOLDS UP THE GAUNTLET. (under his breath) Everybody's coming home... HE SLOWLY SLIPS HIS HAND IN THE GLOVE. SUDDENLY, HE SPASMS, TAKING IN THE POWER AS THANOS DID IN ML1. HE STRUGGLES. What's happening? Take it off, take if off! Bruce, you okay? Talk to me, Banner. 112 I'm...okay... THEN SMART HULK REACHES OUT HIS HAND...AND SNAPS HIS FINGERS. CRAAAACK! THE STONES FLARE. A BRIGHT SURGE OF ENERGY RACES UP SMART HULK'S ARM. HE ROARS AS HIS EYES BLAZE GREEN. A BLAST WHITES OUT THE SCREEN. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY NEBULA studies THE QUANTUM CONSOLE. She takes off her glove, revealing A PERFECTLY INTACT ARM. THIS IS BAD NEBULA. SHE OPENS A PANEL IN HER ARM, SNAKES OUT A CABLE...AND JACKS INTO THE CONSOLE. THE QUANTUM TUNNEL boots up. FROM HIGH OVERHEAD, WE SEE THE TIME ENERGY SIGNATURE SHOOT FROM THE HANGAR. AN OMINOUS RIPPLE WARPS ACROSS THE SKY... INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY WHOOSH! EVERYTHING COMES BACK INTO VIEW. THE GAUNTLET FALLS OFF, ROLLING ACROSS THE FLOOR. SMART HULK COLLAPSES, ARM WITHERED, SIDE BURNT BLACK. EVERYONE RUSHES OVER. Steve checks Smart Hulk's pulse. Bruce! Don't move him! Then THE BLAST DOORS OPEN, revealing the sound of...CHIRPING. SCOTT walks toward the courtyard. Smart Hulk's eyes clear. He grasps Steve's arm. Did it work? They pause, as if it only just now occurred to them. JUST THEN...A CELL PHONE BUZZES. 113 A STUNNED CLINT TURNS AND APPROACHES HIS PHONE. On the home screen, we see A PHOTO OF HIS WIFE: "LAURA CALLING." CLINT FINALLY PUTS THE PHONE TO HIS EAR. Honey? AT THE WINDOW, SCOTT STARES AT A BIRD FEEDER. DOZENS OF CARDINALS AND FINCHES NIBBLE ON THE SEED. Guys, I think it- BOOM! THE BUILDING EXPLODES. DEBRIS SWALLOWS THE CAMERA. A MUSHROOM CLOUD BILLOWS OVER AVENGERS COMPOUND. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY Nothing moves. The smoke clears, revealing...A BOMBED OUT CRATER A MILE WIDE. Avengers Compound has been destroyed. Then the light changes...AND THE SANCTUARY-2 parts the clouds. It hovers over the ruins like a vulture. AN ENERGY BEAM drops to the ground, releasing... THANOS, FLANKED BY A SQUAD OF OUTRIDERS. The Mad Titan looks around at the devastation he has wrought. Daughter? Yes, father... OUT OF THE SMOKE WALKS "BAD" NEBULA. Bruised and dirty. So this is the future. Well done. She tears off THE ORANGE HEAD-PLATE. Thank you, Father. They suspected nothing. The arrogant never do. 114 Thanos takes off his helmet, staring up at the crater's edge. Go. Find the stones. Bring them to me. What will you do? Wait. INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY THE UNDERGROUND GARAGE LIES HALF-COLLAPSED. SMART HULK GRITS HIS TEETH, HOLDING UP THE CEILING WITH ONE GOOD ARM, HIS OTHER ARM BURNED AND LIFELESS. BELOW... RHODEY LIES IN THE RUBBLE, WAR MACHINE SUIT SPARKING. Canopy! Canopy! Rhodey's suit RATCHETS OPEN. HE HAULS HIMSELF FREE to see...ROCKET TRAPPED UNDER RUBBLE. AS HE CRAWLS TO HIM... THE CEILING RUMBLES. SMART HULK WAVERS, MUSCLES QUIVERING. Mayday! Tony. Cap. Does anybody hear me?! HE FINALLY REACHES ROCKET. Rocket wheezes, in pain. Hang on! RHODEY WEDGES A PIECE OF REBAR INTO THE DEBRIS. HE HEAVES, finally managing to lever it off of Rocket. THEN... THE CRACKED CEILING GIVES WAY. A MILLION GALLONS OF RIVER WATER RUSH IN. RHODEY TRIES TO KEEP HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER. Mayday! Mayday! We are taking on water! CLOSE ON SCOTT LANG lying on a SILVER, METAL FLOOR. 115 ...anyone...Mayday...Mayday- Scott groans, coming to. Wait, what...? REVEAL, TINY SCOTT LYING IN THE RUINS OF THE ARMORY...ON THE Tell `em to...hurry...asses up- ...trapped...drowning...no time... Scott jumps to his feet. No! Wait, I'm here! Scott spots WATER TRICKLING THROUGH THE CRACKED FLOOR. WATER DRIPS FROM A HOLE IN THE ROOF OF AN ACCESS TUNNEL...ONTO CLINT BARTON, LYING FACEDOWN. He groans. He opens his hand to find HIS CELLPHONE: HIS WIFE SMILES ON THE SCREEN. "LAURA, ONE MISSED CALL." Clint stares, amazed. He winces, finding he's been lying atop...THE GAUNTLET. It's bashed out of shape, BUT ALL SIX STONES STILL GLEAM. Cap? Stark? Anyone? STATIC. Then, he hears...A SCRAPING SOUND, TALONS ON CEMENT. He peers down a darkened tunnel, then unshoulders his bow. HE LOOSES A FLARE ARROW, revealing... DOZENS OF OUTRIDERS SCRABBLING ALONG THE WALLS AND CEILING. CLINT GRABS THE GAUNTLET AND RUNS. THE CREATURES GIVE CHASE. INT./EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LAB, RUINS - DAY FIRES SMOULDER BENEATH THE COLLAPSED CEILING. MOVE THROUGH SMOKE TO FIND...STEVE, out cold. SOMEONE SHAKES HIM. He wakes to see TONY, HOLDING HIS SHIELD. 116 You lose this again, I'm keeping it. What happened? Told you. We messed with time. Time messed back. Woozy, Steve follows Tony through the ruins of the lab. Where are the others? I read life signs, maybe 800 feet down, but it's hard to tell. They reach the edge of the crater where THOR LOOKS DOWN AT...THANOS. Sitting on a rock. Waiting. What's he been doing? Absolutely nothing. The three of them stare a long moment. Then, as if sensing them, Thanos turns his head...AND LOOKS THEIR WAY. Son of a bitch. Yeah. Where are the stones? Somewhere under all of this. All I know is...he doesn't have `em. So we keep it that way. That lands. This is their chance. You know it's a trap. 117 Don't think I care. Just so we're all in agreement. Thor holds out his hand: MJOLNIR FLIES INTO IT. He holds out his other hand: STORMBREAKER SLAPS INTO HIS PALM. CRACK! LIGHTNING STRIKES AS HE'S COVERED IN CAPE AND ARMOR. Let's kill him properly this time. STEVE TIGHTENS HIS SHIELD, LEADING THEM INTO THE CRATER... EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY Thanos sits on his rock, contemplative. You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Right back to me. TONY APPROACHES, WARY, AS IF SNEAKING UP ON A RABID DOG. STEVE AND THOR FAN OUT ON EITHER SIDE. I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you've shown me that's impossible. (beat) Life clings to the past with bloody fingernails. As long as there are those who remember what was, there will be those unable to accept what can be. They will resist. Yep. We're all kinds of stubborn. I'm thankful. Because now I know what I must do. Thanos reaches for his helmet. I will shred this universe down to its last atom. 118 And then, with the stones you've collected for me, create a new one, teeming with life that knows not what it has lost, but only what it has been given. A grateful universe. Born out of blood. Thanos studies Steve as if seeing him for the first time. They'll never know it. THANOS DRAWS A BLADE OFF HIS BACK, TOWERING OVER THEM. Because you won't be alive to tell them. Tony glances over at Steve. Ready? Steve nods... JUST AS THOR CHARGES THANOS. WHAM! ALL THREE AVENGERS ATTACK, USING THEIR SKILLS IN CONCERT. THANOS STUMBLES, ON HIS HEELS. THE HEROES PUNISH HIM, PULL UP THROUGH THE HAZE, TO THE SANCTUARY-2... INT. SANCTUARY-2, INTERROGATION CELL - DAY NEBULA huddles alone in A PRISON CELL. After a beat...THE DOORS RATCHET OPEN. She stares into the shadows. What do you want? GAMORA STEPS INTO THE CELL. THE TWO SISTERS FROM DIFFERENT In the future...what happens to you and me? I try to kill you. Several times. But, eventually...we become friends. We become sisters. That's hard to believe. 119 A lot of things that happen will be hard to believe. Gamora nearly smiles. She takes a long look at Nebula. Finally...SHE HOLDS OUT HER HAND. Come on. We can still stop him. Nebula takes a deciding moment. Then SHE GRABS GAMORA'S HAND. One sister pulls the other to her feet. INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY SMART HULK STRAINS AGAINST THE CEILING. RHODEY HANGS ONTO A Rhodey. Rocket. Get out of here. Save yourselves. ROCKET SURFACES FROM BELOW, GASPING. No good. Couldn't even...find a hole...small enough to abandon you through. Suddenly, Smart Hulk snarls in pain as THE CEILING DROPS A FOOT. His legs buckle as he struggles against the weight. Finally he sets his jaw...AND STRAIGHTENS HIS LEGS. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - CONTINUOUS THE BUILDING RIGHTS ITSELF, LEVELING OUT. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RUINS - DAY A RAGING RIVER ROARS THROUGH THE RUINS. AFTER A BEAT...SCOTT LANG ZOOMS PAST, RIDING A PLASTIC BOTTLE CAP. 120 SHRIEKING OUTRIDERS CHASE BARTON THROUGH THE TUNNELS. CLINT AFFIXES ARROW-CHARGES TO THE WALLS AS HE RUNS. Just as the Outriders are about to overtake him, Clint hits a button on his bow, DETONATING THE CHARGES... BRINGING THE ROOF DOWN ON TOP OF THE OUTRIDERS. Clint rolls, coming up directly underneath A VERTICAL SHAFT. A cluster of Outriders escape the collapse, lunging for him. Clint shoots a grappling arrow up the shaft, ascending...BUT SO DO THE OUTRIDERS, skittering up the sides. Clint draws his katana, slashing the aliens just as... INT. ACCESS TUNNEL, UPPER CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS HE TUMBLES INTO THE UPPER CHAMBER. He gasps, safe. Then he looks up to see (BAD) NEBULA, LOOMING OVER HIM. Oh, hey. I know you. She gently takes the Gauntlet. Father. I have the stones. What- Clint tries to get up, but Nebula puts a boot in his chest and A BLASTER TO HIS HEAD... Stop. COVERING CLINT, BAD NEBULA TURNS TO SEE...GAMORA, GUN RAISED. You're betraying us? Not you. GOOD NEBULA steps from the shadows, hands raised, placating. Bad Nebula stares at her future self. 121 You don't have to do this. I am this. No. You're not. Good Nebula takes a tiny step forward. She taps her head. You've seen what we become- Sister, listen to her- Shut up. You're a traitor! You can change. Bad Nebula struggles, her face a twisted grimace. He won't let me. BAD NEBULA FIRES AT GAMORA, JUST AS GOOD NEBULA DRAWS A GUN AND SHOOTS HER DOWN. BAD NEBULA DROPS. Good Nebula stares at her dead younger self, conflicted. Clint picks up the gauntlet, very confused. I'm not even gonna ask. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY TONY'S HUD: TONY GLARES RIGHT AT US, AS... THOR SMASHES HIS HAMMERS TOGETHER, HURLING LIGHTNING INTO THE TONY SENDS THE RESULTING OVERLOAD AT THANOS...BUT THANOS PROPELLERS HIS BLADE, HOLDING BACK THE BLAST. THOR USES STORMBREAKER TO BAT MJOLNIR AT THANOS... THANOS SNATCHES TONY BY THE ANKLE AND USES HIM AS A SHIELD AGAINST THE ONCOMING HAMMER. WHACK! 122 MJOLNIR PLOWS INTO THE DIRT. TONY GOES TUMBLING, OUT COLD. TONY'S HUD: FRIDAY TRIES TO REVIVE HIM. Boss? Wake up! INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY ROCKET, RHODEY, AND SMART HULK GULP AIR, INCHES FROM THE CEILING, FACING THE END. RHODEY GLANCES OVER AT SMART HULK. See you on the other side, man. They take a last breath, THEN THE WATER HITS THE CEILING. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY Steve slashes at Thanos. The Titan brutally bats him aside. Thor attacks, but Thanos drives him through walls of debris. THANOS SMASHES HIS FIST INTO THOR'S FACE, OVER AND OVER. Thor calls for Stormbreaker, but Thanos intercepts it. He presses the blade into Thor's chest, trying to drive it home. Then, across the field...MJOLNIR RISES INTO THE AIR. THANOS GRINS, ABOUT TO FINISH THOR OFF, WHEN...MJOLNIR FLIES IN, KNOCKING THE AXE OUT OF HIS HAND. Follow the hammer as it flies back to the only other man worthy enough to wield it...STEVE ROGERS. Half-conscious, THOR SEES STEVE HOLDING MJOLNIR. I...knew...it... STEVE ATTACKS, CRACKING THANOS IN THE JAW. THANOS TUMBLES. BEFORE THE TITAN CAN GET UP, STEVE CALLS DOWN THE LIGHTNING AND SENDS IT CRACKLING INTO THANOS' BODY. Steve leaps, trying to finish Thanos off...BUT THANOS ROLLS ASIDE, HEAD-BUTTING STEVE BACKWARDS. THANOS GETS TO HIS FEET, A FAINT SMILE ON HIS FACE. HE WHIPS OFF HIS HELMET AND ATTACKS STEVE WITH HIS BLADE. BLOW AFTER BLOW. IT'S ALL STEVE CAN DO TO GET HIS SHIELD UP. 123 THANOS HACKS THE SHIELD TO PIECES, FINALLY KNOCKING STEVE Steve lies beaten, half a shield still attached to his arm. In all my years of conquest... Thanos looks out at the tiny human struggling to stand. Of violence and slaughter...it was never personal. Thanos gestures behind him as A RUMBLE ECHOES. THOUSANDS OF ALIENS RING THE LIP OF THE CRATER: THE BLACK ORDER LEADS A PLATOON OF CHITAURI, SAKAARANS, AND OUTRIDERS. But I'll tell you now, the things I'm about to do to your stubborn, annoying, little planet... Q-SHIPS, DROPSHIPS, NECROCRAFT, AND LEVIATHANS BUZZ ABOVE. I'm going to enjoy it. Very, very much. Steve stares at Thanos and his army. And even in the face of such overwhelming odds...he gets to his feet. THANOS stares, almost sad, as Steve tightens the broken shield on his arm...AND STARTS WALKING TOWARD HIM. One man against thousands. All alone. But just then, Steve's COM CRACKLES. He strains to hear. The com crackles again. We can make out A MUFFLED VOICE. -ap-...-comin-...-ot- Steve shakes his head, trying to clear it. Slowly, SOUND RETURNS...AND THE WORDS RING CLEAR: Cap. On your left. PULL BACK...TO SEE A PORTAL OPENING IN THE DISTANCE. OUT OF 124 Steve watches Sam soar over the field, then turns AS EVEN FROM ONE: DR. STRANGE, PETER QUILL, DRAX, MANTIS, PETER PARKER...AND KRAGLIN AND THE RAVAGERS. FROM ANOTHER: T'CHALLA, OKOYE, SHURI, M'BAKU, WANDA, BUCKY, GROOT...AND THE WAKANDAN ARMY. FROM A THIRD: VALKYRIE, KORG, MIEK...AND AN ASGARDIAN ARMY. FROM A FOURTH: PEPPER POTTS (IN RESCUE ARMOR), HOPE VAN DYNE, AND WONG LEADING A SQUAD OF SORCERERS. THOR gets to his feet, calling Stormbreaker to his hand as...TONY regains consciousness, staring out at the cavalry. Wong and Strange quickly find each other. Is that everyone? You wanted more?! JUST THEN, THE GROUND SHAKES AND RUBBLE EXPLODES UPWARDS AS...GIANT-MAN BURSTS FROM BELOW. Top floor, everybody out! HE OPENS HIS HUGE HAND, RELEASING ROCKET, SMART HULK, AND RHODEY, NOW IN HIS COSMIC IRON PATRIOT ARMOR. STEVE TAKES IN HIS REINFORCEMENTS, THEN STARES OUT AT THANOS. PAN ACROSS OUR HEROES AS STEVE CALLS MJOLNIR TO HIS HAND. Avengers...assemble. THOR LETS LOOSE A BATTLE CRY AS HE CHARGES! EVERYONE FOLLOWS SUIT AS OUR HEROES FLOOD THE FIELD. ACROSS THE WAY, THANOS SMILES AND POINTS HIS BLADE. TWO MIGHTY ARMIES RACE TOWARD EACH OTHER UNTIL...CLASH! GIANT-MAN SLUGS A LEVIATHAN IN THE JAW. DRAX launches himself onto a CULL currently choking the life out of KORG. 125 TONY blasts overhead. RESCUE joins him. Together, they strafe the field. STEVE and THOR fight together. Both hold out their hands. Stormbreaker returns to Steve, Mjolnir to Thor, who frowns. No. You take the little one. Elsewhere, TONY BATTLES SEVERAL CULLS. One knocks him into an Outrider, who's about to rip his armor off when... THWIP. PETER PARKER webs the Outrider, yanking him into the path of...GIANT-MAN'S FOOT. SQUISH. Tony stares at Peter, emotional. They retract their helmets. Mr. Stark. Holy cow, you would not believe what's been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? I must've passed out, because I woke up and you weren't there, but Dr. Strange was, and he was like, "it's been five years, they need us." And he started doing that yellow sparkly thing he does- But Tony just wraps his arms around him, smashing Peter's face into his chest plate. (muffled) Oh. This is nice. ACROSS THE FIELD...QUILL flies, firing down on Sakaaran soldiers. One leaps off an outcropping... TACKLING QUILL INTO A WRECKED FUSELAGE, WHERE ANOTHER Quill drops one, but the other raises his weapon to strike. THEN BLAM! The Sakaaran drops dead on top of Quill. He pushes the body off to see...GAMORA, BLASTER STILL SMOKING. Quill stares, amazed. Gamora? HE APPROACHES, OVERWHELMED, EMOTIONAL. 126 I thought I lost you. He tenderly strokes her face...and she knees him in the nuts. Twice. He goes down, gasping. You missed the first time...then you got `em both the second time. She stares down at him as...NEBULA JOINS HER. This is the one? Seriously? Your choices were him or a tree. ACROSS THE FIELD...CLINT RUNS WITH THE GAUNTLET, PURSUED BY A CHITAURI APE. Just before the ape tramples Clint... SAM WILSON SWOOPS IN, CUTTING THE CREATURE DOWN. Clint runs on. The heroes confer over coms. What do you want to do with this thing? Get those stones as far away as possible! No! We need to send them back where they came from. There's no way to send them back. Thanos destroyed our time machine. Hold on! (shrinking to normal size) That wasn't our only time machine. He clicks the KEYS TO LUIS' VAN. From a distance, we hear, "LA CUCARACHA." Steve immediately gets it. Does anyone see an ugly, brown van out there? ABOVE, VALKYRIE SCANS THE FIELD FROM HER PEGASUS. 127 Yeah. But you're not going to like where it's parked. LUIS' VAN SITS SURROUNDED BY THOUSANDS OF ALIENS, DEEP BEHIND STEVE SURVEYS THE FIELD: AN ARMY STANDS BETWEEN THEM AND THE VAN, AIR AND GROUND CHOKED WITH ENEMIES. Scott, how long do you need to get that thing working? Uh, maybe ten minutes. Get it started. We'll get the stones to you. We're on it, Cap. SCOTT glances at her. Cap? THEY SHRINK DOWN AND FLY AWAY. TONY FLIES UP TO DR. STRANGE, HOVERING. Doc. You said we win one in 14 million. Is this how it goes down? If I tell you what happens, it won't happen. You better be right. Tony rockets away. Strange coolly watches him go. ACROSS THE FIELD...EBONY MAW RUSHES TO THANOS. Sire, the stones! THANOS TURNS TO SEE...CLINT FIGHTING THROUGH THE HORDE, A CULL HAMMERS CLINT, BUT THEN...T'CHALLA SLASHES THE CULL. Clint, give it to me. 128 CLINT HANDS THE GAUNTLET TO T'CHALLA, WHO TUCKS IT AND RUNS. ACROSS THE FIELD...SCOTT AND HOPE FLY OVER A LONG PLATOON OF INT./EXT LUIS' VAN - CONTINUOUS They GROW TO NORMAL SIZE in the front seat. Out the windshield, THANOS' HORDE CHARGES AT THEIR FRIENDS. (digging around) Ignition's broken. I'll hotwire it- Wait, you know how to do that? Scott splices wires. Sparks fly. I was in prison. I know how to do a lot of things. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY T'CHALLA RACES THROUGH THE HORDE...BUT THEN THANOS KNOCKS HIM OFF HIS FEET. THE GAUNTLET GOES TUMBLING. AS THANOS MOVES IN ON T'CHALLA...ALL AROUND, WRECKAGE BEGINS TO FLOAT. THANOS LOOKS UP TO SEE... WANDA, HOVERING IN THE AIR, WAITING FOR HIM. You took everything from me. Thanos takes THE BLADE off his back. I don't even know who you are. You will. WANDA UNLEASHES A STORM OF RED ENERGY, HURLING WRECKAGE AT HIM. AS THANOS FIGHTS HIS WAY THROUGH IT... T'CHALLA DIVES FOR THE FALLEN GAUNTLET. SUDDENLY...EBONY MAW MANIPULATES THE EARTH, PULLING THE GAUNTLET TOWARD HIM. T'CHALLA WRAPS HIMSELF AROUND THE GLOVE, GETTING DRAGGED. 129 T'CHALLA TURNS TO SEE PETER WHIZZING PAST. HE HURLS THE GAUNTLET...THWIP! Peter snatches it out of the air. HE LANDS, ONLY TO FIND HIMSELF SURROUNDED BY OUTRIDERS. Activate instant kill! His robotic arms slash with expert precision. ACROSS THE FIELD...WANDA LIFTS THANOS INTO THE AIR, RIPS HIS ARMOR OFF IN PIECES, THEN SLAMS HIM BACK TO THE GROUND. Thanos groans, outmatched. Rain fire. Wipe them all out. But, sire, our troops- Just do it! HIGH ABOVE...THE SANCTUARY-2 DESCENDS, CANNONS OPENING UP. BELOW...WANDA looks up, raising a force field just as... THE SANCTUARY-2 FIRES DOWN WITH EVERYTHING IT HAS. SAKAARANS AND JABARI ALIKE GO FLYING AS EVERY SQUARE INCH GETS HIT. THE BARRAGE HAMMERS THE RIVERBANK. CRACKS FORM. PEPPER CUTS DOWN AN ALIEN, THEN SPOTS SOMETHING OFF SCREEN. Um, is anyone else seeing this? TONY, SMART HULK, AND GAMORA turn to see...WATER GUSHING AS THE RIVERBANK THREATENS TO COLLAPSE. SUDDENLY... STRANGE AND WONG CONJURE TWO HUGE RUNE SHIELDS TO SHORE UP THE BANK. MORE WIZARDS JOIN, CREATING A HUGE "RUNE LEVEE." THE SANCTUARY-2 MAINTAINS ITS BARRAGE. ACROSS THE FIELD...STEVE spots PETER PARKER gradually being overwhelmed by Outriders. 130 I got this...I got this...I don't got this. Hey, Queens! Heads up! STEVE HURLS MJOLNIR OVER THE THRONG. PETER WEBS ON...LETTING THE HAMMER PULL HIM OUT OF DANGER. A MORTAR BLAST KNOCKS HIM OUT OF THE SKY, BUT PEPPER POTTS Hang on, kid. I've got you. She drags him above the fray, then tosses him to...VALKYRIE FLYING PAST. PETER PERCHES ATOP PEGASUS. Hey, nice to meet you-aaaaarg! VALKYRIE SPURS INTO HIGH GEAR, DODGING CANNON FIRE... BUT NOT FAST ENOUGH. A BLAST KNOCKS PETER TO THE GROUND. HE GASPS, COVERED IN DEBRIS, STILL CLUTCHING THE GAUNTLET. ALL AROUND THE FIELD, THE RELENTLESS BARRAGE PINS DOWN OUR Rocket and Groot dive for cover. Groot wraps his branches around them both. At least we're going out together this time... SUDDENLY, EVERYTHING GOES SILENT. ROCKET PEERS OUT FROM COVER TO SEE...THE CANNONS SWIVELING UP TOWARD THE CLOUDS. SAM WILSON flies overhead. What the hell is this? TONY'S HUD: TONY FLIES OVERHEAD, SEARCHING UPWARD. Friday, what are they firing at? Something just entered the upper atmosphere. 131 Rocket looks up at...A COMET HEADING STRAIGHT FOR EARTH. (nervous) I am Groot. Rocket grins, knowing what's coming. Just wait for it. SUDDENLY, THE COMET VEERS...RIGHT TOWARD THE SHIP. BOOM! THE COMET TEARS THROUGH THE SANCTUARY-2, RIGHT OUT THE OTHER SIDE, REVEALING...CAROL DANVERS. Oh, yeah! CAROL GLOWS BRIGHTER AS SHE GOES BINARY, ROCKETING AGAIN THROUGH THE HULL. BOOM! THE SHIP LISTS, ENGINES EXPLODING. CAROL EYES THE BATTLEFIELD, EXHAUSTED, LIGHT FADING. Danvers! We're gonna need an assist down here! (under ragged breath) Roger...Rogers... Scott twists wires on the Quantum Tunnel, hotwiring it. I'm almost there. Where's the glove? CAROL LANDS IN FRONT OF A DAZED PETER PARKER, WHO STILL HOLDS THE GAUNTLET TIGHT. HE LOOKS UP, CONFUSED. Uh, hey. I'm Peter Parker. Hey, Peter Parker. You got something for me? 132 Peter hands it over, staring out at the approaching horde. I don't know how you're gonna get it through all that- Don't worry, kid... Peter turns to see... WANDA, OKOYE, GAMORA, NEBULA, VALKYRIE, HOPE, AND SHURI WAITING. Wanda's hands begin to glow. She's got help. Carol glances at PEPPER and MANTIS, then tucks the gauntlet under her arm AND LEADS THEM OUT. AT THE RIDGE...Thanos spots THE WOMEN OF MARVEL BLASTING THROUGH HIS TROOPS. HE TRACKS THEIR PATH TO...THE VAN. SCOTT KICKS THE REAR DOORS OPEN, EXPOSING THE QUANTUM TUNNEL. Thirty seconds! Thanos understands immediately. HE GRABS PROXIMA'S SPEAR FROM HER, AND STARTS RUNNING... ACROSS THE FIELD...EBONY MAW SENDS WANDA TUMBLING, BUT SHURI CULL OBSIDIAN HAMMERS VALKYRIE, BUT NEBULA TAKES HIM OUT. CAROL KEEPS GOING, GAUNTLET TUCKED UNDER HER ARM, GETTING THE VAN...WHERE THE QUANTUM TUNNEL BURSTS TO LIFE. ACROSS THE FIELD...GROUNDED HEROES LOOK UP TO SEE CAROL NOW JUST YARDS AWAY FROM THE GOAL. SHE PUTS HER HEAD DOWN, FLYING FOR ALL SHE'S WORTH. BUT JUST AS SHE REACHES THE GAPING VAN DOORS... BOOM! THE VAN EXPLODES, SENDING SCOTT AND CAROL FLYING, TAKING OUT SOME OF THE WIZARDS HOLDING BACK THE RIVER. THANOS CATCHES PROXIMA'S RETURNING SPEAR. 133 TIME SLOWS AS...STEVE, THOR, AND TONY SPOT...THE GAUNTLET, The problem is...SO DOES THANOS. TIME RESUMES AS...THEY ALL SCRAMBLE FOR THE STONES. THEY COLLIDE. THANOS SNATCHES UP THE GAUNTLET, KICKING THOR DOWN. THANOS KNOCKS TONY ASIDE, THEN SQUEEZES THE CRUSHED GAUNTLET, POPPING IT OPEN...JUST WIDE ENOUGH TO PUT HIS HAND INSIDE. STEVE LUNGES, BUT THANOS THROTTLES HIM. FINALLY CLEAR, THANOS SLIPS ON THE GAUNTLET. BUT BEFORE HE CAN SNAP... CAROL ARRIVES. SHE GRABS THE GLOVE, PREVENTING HIM FROM CLOSING HIS FIST. HE HEADBUTTS HER...BUT SHE DOESN'T MOVE. CAROL PRESSES THANOS DOWN, BUT BEFORE HE FALLS... THANOS PULLS THE POWER STONE FROM ITS HOUSING AND PUNCHES THE FIELD GOES QUIET. NOW, NOTHING STANDS IN THANOS' WAY. Tony gets to his knees, realizing... The Avengers are going to lose. ACROSS THE FIELD...WATER STARTS TO SPILL INTO THE CRATER. STRANGE TRIES TO HOLD IT BACK...BUT IT'S A LOSING BATTLE. He looks to Tony... Tony meets his eye. And in that moment, all Strange can do is hold up a single finger. "One." ACROSS THE FIELD...THANOS RETURNS THE POWER STONE TO THE GAUNTLET. JUST AS THE ENERGY SURGES THROUGH HIM... TONY LUNGES FOR THE GAUNTLET IN THANOS' HAND, NANO-CLAMPING IT IN A VISE. THANOS KNOCKS HIM ASIDE. HE LIFTS HIS HAND IN THE AIR, TRIUMPHANT. I am...inevitable. THANOS SNAPS HIS FINGERS. But nothing happens. Confused, Thanos turns the glove over to find...THE STONES ARE GONE. He looks to see...TONY, NANO-PARTICLES SLIDING AND SHIFTING, FORMING A NEW GAUNTLET ON HIS OWN WRIST: 134 COMPLETE WITH SIX INFINITY STONES. POWER SURGES THROUGH TONY, EXCRUCIATING, BUT HE STILL LIFTS HIS HAND... And I...am Iron Man. WHOOSH. THE TIDAL WAVE EVAPORATES INTO MIST. ALL AROUND THE FIELD, SAKAARANS AND OUTRIDERS FOLD IN ON THEMSELVES, ATOMS DISINTEGRATING. THANOS LOOKS AROUND, WATCHING HIS TROOPS DISAPPEAR. SHIPS VANISH FROM THE SKY. CULLS, CHITAURI, ALL BLOW AWAY... LEAVING THANOS STANDING ALONE. AFTER A LONG MOMENT, HE SITS DOWN ON A ROCK...AND ACCEPTS HIS FATE. He watches as... HIS ATOMS DISSOLVE. FINALLY, THANOS DISAPPEARS. ACROSS THE FIELD, QUILL turns to GAMORA...BUT FINDS HER GONE. Babe? Gamora? ACROSS THE FIELD...TONY STARK FALLS BACK AGAINST THE UPTURNED ROOTS OF A TREE, ARMOR SMOKING, ARM WITHERED AND BLACKENED. Dying. RHODEY RUSHES TO HIM, BUT WITH ONE LOOK, HE KNOWS IT'S TOO LATE. TONY EXHALES, ALMOST LETTING GO. Then... PETER PARKER lands, kneeling, taking Tony's hand. Mr. Stark...Tony...it's okay, it's okay...Mr. Stark, we won. You did it, sir... But Tony gazes past him. Rhodey puts his hand on Peter's shoulder, guiding him away... AS PEPPER ARRIVES. She kneels, heartsick. Hey, Friday, what've we got? Life functions critical. Pepper stares into her husband's eyes...and knows. 135 Tony, look at me. We're going to be okay... He stares at her, tears welling. I'm sorry. She touches his face, then leans in to kiss him. You can rest now. When she pulls back, she sees his eyes, fixed and glassy. Everything goes quiet. All around, OUR HEROES GATHER, the full weight of what's happened dawning on them. Tony Stark is gone. EXT. HIGH SCHOOL NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT PETER PARKER enters a hallway teeming with students. He searches the crowd, finally finding...NED LEEDS. As they embrace... Fireworks explode over the skyline of San Francisco. Everybody wants a happy ending. But it doesn't always roll that way. Maybe this time. On Cassie's porch, SCOTT watches with HOPE and CASSIE, all of them grinning. EXT. BARTON HOME, FRONT PORCH - DAY TWO BIKES lean on the porch of THE BARTON FARM HOUSE. Then the front door opens...and COOPER and LILA BARTON step out. I'm hoping if you play this back, it's in celebration. 136 I hope families are reunited, I hope we get it back and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored. If there ever was such a thing. She looks up at...A QUINJET descending from the sky. ON THE PALACE BALCONY...T'CHALLA embraces his mother, RAMONDA. Shuri turns from them to the magnificent sunset. God, what a world. Universe, now. If you'd told me ten years ago that we weren't alone, let alone to this extent, I probably wouldn't have been surprised. But come on... The Quinjet touches down. The rear jump door opens, revealing CLINT. He stares at Lila and Cooper, overwhelmed. Who knew what epic forces of dark and light would come into play? For better or worse, that's the reality our children get to grow up in. They throw themselves into his arms. He kisses their heads, tears in his eyes. Finally, he looks up to see... LAURA BARTON, beaming, tearful, holding THREE YEAR-OLD NATHANIEL'S HAND. Clint gathers them all into a hug. INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LIVING ROOM - DAY A HOLOGRAM of TONY STARK projects from an IRON MAN HELMET on the table. That's why I thought I'd probably better record a little greeting, in the case of...an untimely death on my part. 137 I mean, death at any time is untimely, but...this "time travel" thing we're going to try to pull off tomorrow has me scratching my head about the "survivability" of it all. But that's the hero gig, right? Part of the journey is the end. REVERSE to find PEPPER, MORGAN, HAPPY HOGAN, RHODEY, THOR, STEVE, SMART HULK, and CLINT, all dressed in black, watching. What am I even tripping for? Everything is going to work out exactly the way it's supposed to. HOLO TONY seems to look out at the gathered heroes...and Morgan in particular. I love you 3000. He switches off the camera, vanishing. Tears streaming, Pepper kisses Morgan's forehead. EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, BACK STAIRS - DAY PEPPER and MORGAN slowly descend the stairs, carrying an RT RINGED WITH FLOWERS. The Avengers follow, somber. EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LAKESIDE - DAY PEPPER RESTS THE FLOWERS ON THE WATER. CLOSE ON THE RT: "Proof That Tony Stark Has A Heart." Pull back, past Morgan and HAPPY HOGAN... PAST STEVE, SAM, RHODEY, AND WANDA... PAST CLINT, LAURA, LILA, COOPER, and NATHANIEL... PAST SCOTT, HOPE, HANK PYM, and JANET VAN DYNE... PAST PETER PARKER and AUNT MAY... PAST T'CHALLA, OKOYE, and SHURI, 138 PAST STRANGE and WONG... PAST QUILL, NEBULA, GROOT, MANTIS, and ROCKET... PAST SECRETARY ROSS and HARLEY KEENER... PAST MARIA HILL, CAROL DANVERS, and, finally, NICK FURY. THE MOURNERS MOVE TO THE EDGE OF THE LAKE. EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LAKESIDE - DAY LATER...CLINT looks out at the lake. WANDA approaches. I just wish there were some way I could let her know that we won. That we did it. She knows. They both do. Clint puts his arm around her. They stare out at the water. EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, PORCH/BACK STAIRS- DAY ON THE PORCH, HAPPY HOGAN HOLDS MORGAN'S HAND. How are you doing, squirt? You hungry? Uh, huh. What do you want? Cheeseburgers? Happy takes a beat, choked up. Like father like daughter. Did you know your dad liked cheeseburgers? No, I didn't know that. 139 I'm going to get you all the cheeseburgers you want. EXT. NEW ASGARD, HILLSIDE - DAY THOR and VALKYRIE look down on NEW ASGARD. So when can we expect you back? About that... Thor, your people need a king. They already have one. And she's a far better king than I could ever be. Are you serious? It's time to be who I am, rather than who I'm supposed to be. And a leader is who you are. She processes this. Does she want it? She does. You know, I'd make a lot of changes around here. I'm counting on it, Your Majesty. Emotional, Val finally SHAKES HIS HAND. What will you do? I'm not entirely sure. For the first time in a thousand years, I have no path. (beat) But I do have a ride. REVEAL...THE BENATAR parked behind them, Rocket alongside. 140 Move it or lose it, Hairbag. THOR drops his duffle bag on the deck of the Benatar. QUILL, MANTIS, DRAX, NEBULA, and ROCKET ready the engines. Home sweet home. Tree! Good to see you. The Asgardians of the Galaxy, together again. He settles beside Quill, who holomaps their course. All right, where first? He swipes through images on the screen. You know, I'm still in charge, here, right? Of course. Of course... Thor swipes the map again. See, when you keep swiping my map, that sounds kind of like, "of course, I know you think you're still in charge-" Quail, that's your own insecurities bubbling up. You should fight one another for the honor of leadership. Sounds fair. That's not necessary... I've got some blasters right here. Unless you want to use knives. 141 Oh, yes, please, use knives- No one's using knives! I am Groot! Quill and Thor exchange nervous laughter. There'll be no knifing young Quail today. Everyone knows who's in charge. A long awkward moment passes. Me. (sotto, to Thor) Right? Thor just smiles... EXT. NEW ASGARD, HILLSIDE - DAY The ship rises. WHOOSH. IT MAKES THE JUMP AND DISAPPEARS. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RUINS - DAY CONSTRUCTION CREWS REMOVE RUBBLE FROM AVENGERS COMPOUND. A COMMAND TENT stands in a clearing beside... As STEVE, SAM, and BUCKY wait, SMART HULK makes last minute adjustments. He finally opens A CASE: THE SIX INFINITY STONES GLOW INSIDE. Remember, you'll have to return the stones to the exact moment they were taken. Otherwise, we're still looking at a whole bunch of nasty alternate realities. Got it. I'll clip all the branches. 142 Steve takes the case. You know, I tried. When I had the gauntlet. I really tried to bring her back. (beat) I miss her. Me, too. You'd better get going. We're almost ready for you. Steve and Sam approach the platform. You look a little nervous going by yourself. Ask nicely, I'll go with you. You're a good man, Sam. But this one's on me. When Steve reaches the platform, BUCKY stops him, pointed. Don't do anything stupid `til I get back, okay? How can I? You're taking all the stupid with you. Steve grins. Bucky gives him a long hug. Gonna miss you, buddy. It's going to be okay, Buck. Steve picks up Mjolnir and takes his place on the platform. SAM LOOKS TO SMART HULK AT THE CONSOLE. How long's this gonna take? 143 For him, as long as he needs. For us, five seconds. (calling out) Ready, Cap? You're good to go. Meet you right back here, okay? Steve glances at Bucky as he answers. You bet. Going Quantum in three, two, one. STEVE TAPS HIS CUFF AND SHRINKS TO NOTHING. Aaand, returning in five... four...three...two...one- Silence. Nothing happens. Where is he? I don't know. He blew past our time stamp. He should be here. Get him back! I'm trying. Get him the hell back- Just then...Bucky looks out to the water. Sam. Sam turns... EXT AVENGERS COMPOUND, RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS Work crews have cleared a space overlooking the river. There, AN OLD MAN sits on a bench, staring out at the Hudson. 144 Move around him to find SAM watching from A FEW YARDS AWAY. Hey, Cap. The man turns and we now see: STEVE ROGERS, age 112. Hi, Sam. Something go wrong...or something go right? I thought, after everything that's happened...maybe I should try out some of that life Tony always told me to get. How was it? Steve looks at the river, 112 years of emotion in his face. It was beautiful. I'm happy for you. Really. Thanks. Only thing bumming me out is now I live in a world without Captain America. Steve pulls up A CASE from beside him, giving it to Sam. That's kind of why I'm here. Sam unzips it, revealing...A BRAND NEW SHIELD. Where did you even get this? I had a little time to travel. (beat) Try it on. 145 Sam hesitates. He glances back at Bucky, who nods. Then Sam picks up the shield...and puts it on. How does it feel? Like it's someone else's. It isn't. Sam tries to check his emotion. He shakes Steve's hand. Thank you. I'll try my best. Steve rests his other hand on Sam's. That's why it's yours. Sam smiles, noticing...STEVE'S TARNISHED WEDDING RING. You gonna tell me about her? Steve smiles to himself at the end of a long, long life. Nope. I don't think I will. CUE MUSIC: "IT'S BEEN A LONG, LONG TIME," HARRY JAMES. EXT. COLUMBIA HEIGHTS, WASHINGTON DC - DAY A PACKARD rolls down a block of WASHINGTON D.C. ROW HOUSES. TITLE: "WASHINGTON D.C., 1949." Find a red house in the middle of the block. Move up the steps to the front door...WHICH HANGS WIDE OPEN. INT. RED HOUSE, COLUMBIA HEIGHTS, WASHINGTON DC - DAY A TEA CUP LIES SHATTERED on the hardwood. We hear Harry James. Move into the living room...past the record player... TO WHERE STEVE DANCES WITH A WOMAN. They rock back and forth barely moving. As they turn, we see... 146 PEGGY CARTER, tears streaming down her face. He steps on her toe. She laughs. As they turn, we get a good look at... Steve Rogers, eyes shut, finally getting the life he deserves. All rights reserved. Copyright � 2019 Marvel.
